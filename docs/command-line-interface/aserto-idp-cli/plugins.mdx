# Plugins

The `aserto-idp` CLI includes a collections of plugins, each supporting a different identity provider format.

The plugins will be downloaded on the system in a directory under the following path: `$HOME/.aserto/idpplugins` .

Currently, the available plugins are:

- aserto
- okta
- json
- auth0

The plugins can be downloaded in 2 ways:

- using the `get-plugin` command
- calling the `exec` or `delete` command with the name of a plugin that is not on the system (this will automatically download the latest version of that plugin).

## Get a plugin

To download the latest version of a plugin:

```
aserto-idp get-plugin aserto
```

or

```
aserto-idp get-plugin aserto:latest
```

To download a specific version of a plugin:

```
aserto-idp get-plugin aserto:1.0.1
```

:::note
If you don't download the plugins before using the `aserto-idp exec` command, the CLI will automatically download the plugins required to complete the operation.

## Listing plugins

To see the plugins that are downloaded on the system and their version, the `list-plugins` command can be used.

To list plugins that are currently on the system:

```
aserto-idp list-plugins
```

The output will be similar to:

```
    auth0:v0.0.7
    json:0.0.11
    okta:0.0.23
    aserto:0.0.11
```

To list plugins and versions that are available remotely and can be downloaded:

```
aserto-idp list-plugins --remote
```

The output will be similar to:

```
Available versions for 'okta'
*        okta:0.0.23
         okta:0.0.22
         okta:0.0.21
         okta:0.0.20

Available versions for 'json'
         json:0.0.12
*        json:0.0.11
         json:0.0.10

Available versions for 'auth0'
         auth0:0.0.7
         auth0:0.0.6
         auth0:0.0.5

Available versions for 'aserto'
*        aserto:0.0.11
         aserto:0.0.10
```

where `*` symbolize the version that is currently on the system.
