# Configuration

To configure the CLI plugins, create a new directory in a location of your choice, and within it create a YAML file called `config.yaml` with the following contents (including the information for the plugins you intend to use):

```
logging:
  log_level: LEVEL
plugins:
  auth0:
    domain: DOMAIN
    client-id: ID
    client-secret: SECRET
  json:
    from-file: PATH_TO_FILE
    to-file: PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FILE
  aserto:
    tenant: TENANT_ID
    authorizer: AUTHORIZER
    api-key: AUTHORIZER_API_KEY
  okta:
    domain: OKTA_DOMAIN
    api-token: TOKEN
```

## Configuration elements
