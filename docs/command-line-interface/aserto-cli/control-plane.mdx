# Control Plane

Aserto [Edge Authorizers](/docs/edge-authorizers/overview) can connect to the Aserto Control Plane to receive policy and
directory updates and commands. Edge authorizers must use client certificates from Edge Authorizer connections to
connect to the Control Plane.

## Configuration

The Aserto CLI can be used to configure certificates. The `list connections` sub-command lists a tenant's existing
Edge Authorizer connections:

```
aserto control-plane list connections
```

Each of the listed connections has an `id` field, which can be used to retrieve certificate data, including the
certificate and private key:

```
aserto control-plane get certificates <edge-authorizer-connection-id>
```

For more details on how to configure the certificate see the [edge
authorizers](/docs/edge-authorizers/security-and-management) section of this documentation.

## Commands

To list the Edge Authorizer instances connected to the Control Plane:
```
aserto control-plane list instances
```

Each entry in the resulting list will have an `id` field, a `policy-id` field indicating what policy instance the edge
is configured to run and a `remote_host` field which can be used to identify the individual edge instance. The value of
the latter is the `$HOSTNAME` environment variable of the edge host, and will be overridden with the `$ASERTO_HOSTNAME`
environment variable, if it exists.

The `discovery` sub-command causes an Edge Authorizer to immediately fetch configuration from the Control Plane.
```
aserto control-plane exec discovery <instance-registration-id>
```

The `exec edge-sync` sub-command causes an Edge Authorizer to immediately synchronize its local directory state (if
synchronization is enabled).
```
aserto control-plane exec edge-sync <instance-registration-id>
```
