# Decision Logs

## Accessing decision logs storage objects through the CLI

Immutable storage objects are created roughly once an hour for each policy for which decision logging is enabled and
for which decision activity exists during that time period. The storage consists of CSV files containing decision log
events; each one corresponding to a decision performed by some authorizer. Objects for one, more (or all) policies can
be discovered and then downloaded individually using the Aserto CLI. The CLI also supports bulk downloads.

### Listing Objects

```
aserto decision-logs list [--policies=<policy-id1>,<policy-id2>...<policy-idN>]
```

### Fetch a Download URL

For each decision log object name, a download URL can be obtained. The download URL can be used to perform a standard
HTTP download.

```
aserto decision-logs get --info <object name>
```

### Bulk Downloads

The Aserto CLI can also perform bulk downloads, which can be useful when automating ingestion of decision log objects
into analytics tools.

```
aserto decision-logs get [--path <destination path>] \
[--policies <policy-id1>,<policy-id2>...<policyi-idN>]
```

When used this way, the CLI will only download decision log objects which don't already exist in the destination path.
This is safe because, once they exist, decision log objects are final and immutable.

## Other Storage Objects

Asertoâ€™s decision logging system maintains versioned copies of users involved in decisions. These can be accessed using
the Aserto CLI.

### Listing User Objects

```
aserto decision-logs list-users
```

### Fetch a Download URL

For each user object name, a download URL can be obtained. The download URL can be used to perform a standard HTTP
download.

```
aserto decision-logs get-user --info <object name>
```

### Bulk Downloads

The Aserto CLI can also perform bulk downloads, which can be useful when automating ingestion of data referenced by
decision log objects.

```
aserto decision-logs get-users [--path <destination path>]
```

When used this way, the CLI will only download objects that have changed since last downloaded, according to the
metadata on the local versions and remote versions of the objects.

## Using the decision logs API key

The Aserto CLI decision-logs group of commands can be run without a user logged in, i.e. without first running
`aserto login`, and instead using the [decision logs API key](/docs/decision-logs-guide/console#decision-logs-api-key).

To authenticate using the API key use the `--tenant` CLI option and the `--api-key` option of the decision-logs
commands. For example:

```
aserto --tenant 0116e83a-7e21-11ec-ab5b-00c9e2c2068b decision-logs get \
--api-key 877572d643b2a8b6d94e12b461cd4527b2eb1e1a5fa2e9d2be67866642a9d123 \
--path ~/files/decision-logs
```

This command would download all the decision logs for the tenant `0116e83a-7e21-11ec-ab5b-00c9e2c2068b` onto the
specified path authenticating using the specified API key.
