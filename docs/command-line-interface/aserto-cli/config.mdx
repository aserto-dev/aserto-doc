# Creating and managing Aserto configurations

The Aserto CLI provides a convenient way to target its commands at a particular tenant and policy instance. These are known as "configs".

The Aserto CLI leverages [Topaz configurations](https://www.topaz.sh/docs/command-line-interface/topaz-cli/configuration), which can be used to target local configurations. It also adds a convenient way to target **remote** configurations: these are policy instances that are managed by the Aserto SaaS platform.

To access these configurations, be sure to [login](/docs/command-line-interface/aserto-cli/login.mdx) first.

## Aserto configuration commands

For a full listing, type `aserto config`.

```

```

## Listing available configurations

If you are not logged in, the list will display you available Topaz configuration files. Once you've logged in, you will see your available tenants in this list.

Example:
```
aserto config list
     NAME                CONFIG                                
     tenant1.aserto.com  7dxc1dscb-8541-11ee-8530-00fde8f8691a  
     tenant2.aserto.com  c8x4x115-28cb-11rf-b88b-009az7b104e6  
     gdrive              gdrive.yaml                                
     peoplefinder        peoplefinder.yaml                          
     todo                todo.yaml             
```

## Selecting a configuration

Running `aserto config use <name>`, you can select the configuration that will be used by the CLI. 

Please note that for local topaz configurations, some of the remote Aserto CLI commands will not be available.

Once you selected a configuration if you run an `aserto config list` you should see your selection marked as:
Example:
```bash
aserto config use tenant1.aserto.com
```

```bash
aserto config list

     NAME                CONFIG                                
 *   tenant1.aserto.com  7dxc1dscb-8541-11ee-8530-00fde8f8691a  
     tenant2.aserto.com  c8x4x115-28cb-11rf-b88b-009az7b104e6  
     gdrive              gdrive.yaml                                
     peoplefinder        peoplefinder.yaml                          
     todo                todo.yaml             
```

Please note that the `aserto config rename`, `aserto config delete` and `aserto config info` are meant for interacting with you local Topaz configurations only.

For more details regarding these commands, see the [Topaz Configuration Docs](https://www.topaz.sh/docs/command-line-interface/topaz-cli/configuration).

## Issuing commands to remote instances

Once you've selected an Aserto tenant as your current configuration, you can use the [Connections](/docs/command-line-interface/aserto-cli/connections.mdx), [Policies](/docs/command-line-interface/aserto-cli/policies.mdx), [Decision Logs](/docs/command-line-interface/aserto-cli/connections.mdx), and [Control Plane](/docs/command-line-interface/aserto-cli/control-plane.mdx) commands, targeting that tenant.

In addition, all of the [Directory](/docs/command-line-interface/aserto-cli/directory.mdx) and [Authorizer](/docs/command-line-interface/aserto-cli/authorizer.mdx) commands will target that specific tenant.

## Creating an Edge Authorizer configuration

[Edge Authorizers](/docs/edge-authorizers/overview.mdx) are Topaz instances that are managed by the Aserto Control Plane.

Creating an Edge Authorizer configuration allows you to mirror a policy and directory in an Aserto Tenant, but run these locally - either on your workstation, as a microservice, or as a sidecar.

Refer to the [Edge Authorizer CLI docs](/docs/command-line-interface/aserto-cli/onebox.mdx) to learn how to use the `aserto config new` command to create an Edge Authorizer configuration that mirrors one of your policies in your Aserto Tenant.
