## Deploying the Edge Authorizer

Aserto's [Edge Authorizer](/docs/edge-authorizers/overview) is a Topaz instance and is available as a Docker container that you can run locally either in its own container or as a sidecar.

The CLI provides a management experience for Edge Authorizers.

:::note
The Edge Authorizer requires `docker` to be installed and running.
To install Docker on a Mac or Linux system: `brew install --cask docker`
:::

To use the CLI you need to first [login](login) to your Aserto account.

You can then pull down the latest `Topaz` docker image.

```bash
aserto developer install
```

## Configuring

To configure the Edge Authorizer to connect to the Aserto Control Plane, use the following command. Note that EDGE_AUTHORIZER_CONNECTION_ID is the connection ID of an Edge Authorizer that you [created in the Aserto console](/docs/aserto-console/connections/setup-edge.mdx). 

```bash
aserto developer configure <POLICY_INSTANCE_NAME> --edge-authorizer=<EDGE_AUTHORIZER_CONNECTION_ID> [--decision-logging]
```

## Starting 

Finall you can `docker run` a container running an Edge Authorizer with the `peoplefinder` policy configuration, writing the decision logs to `/tmp/decision-logs`:

```bash
aserto developer start peoplefinder --data-path=/tmp/decision-logs
```

These additional commands allow managing the Edge Authorizer instance.

```bash
aserto developer status   # displays the running status of the authorizer
aserto developer stop     # stops the authorizer
aserto developer update   # updates the authorizer image to :latest
```

Once the Edge Authorizer is deployed it needs to be connected to the Aserto Control Plane. To do this, see the [Edge Authorizers](/docs/edge-authorizers/security-and-management) section.
