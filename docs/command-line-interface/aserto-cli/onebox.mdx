## Deploying the Edge Authorizer

Aserto's [Edge Authorizer](/docs/edge-authorizers/overview) is a Topaz instance and is available as a Docker container that you can run locally either in its own container or as a sidecar.

The CLI provides a management experience for Edge Authorizers.

:::note
The Edge Authorizer requires `docker` to be installed and running.
To install Docker on a Mac or Linux system: `brew install --cask docker`
:::

To use the CLI you need to first [login](login) to your Aserto account.

You can then pull down the latest `Topaz` docker image.

```bash
aserto install
```

## Configuring

To configure the Edge Authorizer to connect to the Aserto Control Plane, use the following command. Note that EDGE_AUTHORIZER_CONNECTION_ID is the connection ID of an Edge Authorizer that you [created in the Aserto console](/docs/aserto-console/connections/setup-edge.mdx). 

```bash
aserto config new -n <POLICY_INSTANCE_NAME> --edge-authorizer=<EDGE_AUTHORIZER_CONNECTION_ID> [--decision-logging]
```

## Selection the configuration to run

Once you configure an edge authorizer you should be able to see the configuration file in the `aserto config list` command results.
From there you need to select the configuration file to be able to manage the authorizer using the `aserto config use <POLICY_INSTANCE_NAME>` command.

## Starting 

Finall you can `docker run` a container running an Edge Authorizer with the created policy configuration:

```bash
aserto start
```

These additional commands allow managing the Edge Authorizer instance.

```bash
aserto status   # displays the running status of the authorizer
aserto stop     # stops the authorizer
aserto update   # updates the authorizer image to :latest
```

For more details about the edge authorizer configuration see the [Edge Authorizers](/docs/edge-authorizers/security-and-management) section.
