# Local developer experience (Sidecar)

Aserto's authorizer is available as a docker container that you can run locally.
This "all-in-one" version of the Aserto Authorizer is referred to as the **Sidecar**.

The CLI provides a management experience over the Sidecar.

:::note
The Sidecar requires `docker` to be installed and running.
To install Docker on a Mac or Linux system: `brew install --cask docker`
:::

To get started with the Sidecar, you can pull it down using the Aserto CLI.

Sign in to your Aserto account:

```bash
aserto login
```

The following command will pull down the latest `sidecar` docker image.

```bash
aserto developer install
```

The next command will pull down the configuration for a policy that you've set up in the console, using
the name you gave it (in the example below, `peoplefinder`).

```bash
aserto developer configure peoplefinder
```

The following command will `docker run` a local container with the `peoplefinder` policy configuration, writing the decision logs to `/tmp/decision-logs`:

```bash
aserto developer start peoplefinder --data-path=/tmp/decision-logs
```

The next few commands help manage the `sidecar` docker instance and image.

```bash
aserto developer status   # displays the running status of the authorizer
aserto developer stop     # stops the authorizer
aserto developer update   # updates the authorizer image to :latest
```

The Sidecar can be connected to the Aserto control plane. This enables additional functionality, including the ability to issue commands to the Sidecar remotely. To connect the Sidecar to the Aserto control plane see the [Edge Authorizers](/docs/edge-authorizers/security-and-management) section.
