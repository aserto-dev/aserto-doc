# CLIs

Along with the Aserto Console and the API, Aserto provides two CLI tools:

- The [`aserto` CLI](/docs/command-line-interface/aserto-cli/installation) allows developers interact with Aserto. It has three main functions:

  - Manage [organization](/docs/overview/organization) artifacts (policies, directory, connections)
  - Interact with an [Authorizer](/docs/overview/authorizer)
  - Manage the local developer experience [OneBox](/docs/command-line-interface/aserto-cli/onebox)

  All management operations are done in the context of an Aserto [_organization_](/docs/overview/organization).

- The [`policy` CLI](/docs/command-line-interface/policy-cli/download) allows developers interact with policy images. It has two main functions:
  - Build, sign, and export (unbundle) policy images
  - Push and pull policy images from a policy registry, such as the Aserto Policy Registry or the [Open Policy Registry](https://www.openpolicyregistry.io/)
