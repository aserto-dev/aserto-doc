# Sending a command via the CLI

The `aserto` CLI can be used to send commands to Edge Authorizer instances.

## Required information

Once logged in, the `aserto` CLI will already have the Tenant ID and authorization information to communicate with the `relay` endpoint. You will need to determine the registered instance ID. You can either do this via the [console](/docs/control-plane-guide/api#instance-id), or via the CLI.

```bash
aserto control-plane list-instance-registrations
```

This will return a JSON array with all the Topaz instances that have registered with the control plane, in the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "0c0607e8-3689-491f-b42f-f9eb24409abb",
    "info": {
      "policy_id": "a4966ba0-b626-11ec-810f-018dbb604591",
      "policy_label": "todo",
      "remote_host": "29f48f6dc3f1",
      "connection_id": "bc1bbfe2-20c8-11ee-9069-031f1f3ef1c7",
      "certificate_id": "7a:b9:5c:b9:31:4c:81:00:8a:97:5b:c4:f7:1d:4e:02:b8:40:b1:e4",
      "policy_name": "todo"
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

The `id` field is the one that's required to send control plane commands to the instance.

## Available commands

Two commands are available to send to connected Edge Authorizers:
* Discovery: this will short-circuit the OPA Discovery timer and force an immediate download of a policy image
* Sync Edge Directory: this will short-circuit the Directory timer and force an immediage sync of any new manifest or data in the Central Directory

### Discovery (Sync Policy Instance)

```bash
aserto control-plane discovery <Instance-ID>
```

A successful call will return nothing.

### Sync Edge Directory

```bash
aserto control-plane edge-dir-sync <Instance-ID>
```

A successful call will return nothing.
