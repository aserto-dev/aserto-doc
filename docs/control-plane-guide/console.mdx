# Managing Edge Authorizers

The Aserto Console **Authorizers** tab tracks the Edge Authorizer connections, and within each of these connections, the connected instances.

## Creating an Edge Authorizer connection

To connect a Topaz instance as an Edge Authorizer, follow the instructions on [creating an Edge Authorizer connection](/docs/aserto-console/connections/setup-edge.mdx).

## Viewing registered instances

When Topaz is configured to connect to the Control Plane, it will make an mTLS connection and show up as a registered instance. Each Edge Authorizer connection may have one or more registered instances.

## Sending commands to instances

Two commands are available to send to connected Edge Authorizers:
* Sync Policy Instance: this will short-circuit the OPA Discovery timer and force an immediate download of a policy image
* Sync Edge Directory: this will short-circuit the Directory timer and force an immediage sync of any new manifest or data in the Central Directory

See the screenshot below on how to invoke these commands.
