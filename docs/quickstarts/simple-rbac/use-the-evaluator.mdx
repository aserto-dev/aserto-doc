# Use the Simple RBAC Evaluator

Now that you have created your policy instance, you can test it out with the Evaluator. The Evaluator supports several requests, corresponding to Aserto's authorization APIs - `is`, `decisiontree`, and `query`. The default "Check" request, however, is specifically designed for `policy-rebac`.  Using the Evaluator allows you to quickly verify whether a user has a relationship (or permission) on an object.

The Evaluator has two parts. The `REQUEST` part on the left is where you specify information about the action being performed, while the `OUTPUT` on the right displays the body of the request as well as the response.

The table below explains the selection fields.

|Field|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Subject|The user to evaluate. For Simple RBAC there are 5 Citadel users that you can select from.|
|Object Type|The type of object to evaluate. For Simple RBAC this will be `Resource`.|
|Object|The object instance to evaluate.|
|Relation|Which relation or permission to evaluate.|

## Testing the policy

Now let's check a few different scenarios using the Evalator. First, a few important things to note about Rick and Morty:

* Morty is an `owner` of the `mega-seed` object. This means he has the `can_read`, `can_write`, and `can_delete` permissions which correspond to reading, writing, or deleting the `mega-seed`.  
* Rick is a `reader` of the `mega-seed` object. This means he only has the `can_read` permission.

### Scenario 1 - can Morty read the `mega-seed`?

* For Subject, select "Morty Smith".
* For Object Type, select "Resource".
* For Object, select "mega-seed".
* For Relation, select "can-read".
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": true` under results indicating the action will be permitted.

### Scenario 2 - can Rick read the `mega-seed`?

* For Subject, select "Rick Sanchez".
* For Object Type, select "Resource".
* For Object, select "mega-seed".
* For Relation, select "can-read".
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": true` under results indicating the action will be permitted.

### Scenario 3 - can Morty write the `mega-seed`?

* For Subject, select "Morty Smith".
* For Object Type, select "Resource".
* For Object, select "mega-seed".
* For Relation, select "can-write".
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": true` under results indicating the action will be permitted.

### Scenario 4 - can Rick write the `mega-seed`?

* For Subject, select "Rick Sanchez".
* For Object Type, select "Resource".
* For Object, select "mega-seed".
* For Relation, select "can-write".
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": false` under results indicating the action will be denied.

### Scenario 5 - can Morty delete the `mega-seed`?

* For Subject, select "Morty Smith".
* For Object Type, select "Resource".
* For Object, select "mega-seed".
* For Relation, select "can-delete".
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": true` under results indicating the action will be permitted.

### Scenario 6 - can Rick delete the `mega-seed`?

* For Subject, select "Rick Sanchez".
* For Object Type, select "Resource".
* For Object, select "mega-seed".
* For Relation, select "can-delete".
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": false` under results indicating the action will be denied.

## Next steps

Now that you have seen how the policy works, you'll use the Quickstart in the console to download and run the sample back-end API, which uses the `simple-rbac` policy for access control.

Click on the "Quickstart" tab on the left.
