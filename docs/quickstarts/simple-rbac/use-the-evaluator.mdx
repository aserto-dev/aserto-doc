# Use the Simple RBAC Evaluator

Now that you have created your policy instance, you can test it out with the Evaluator. The Evaluator has several different modes, the default "Check" mode is specifically for policy-rebac.  Using the Evalator allows you to quickly verify whether an action performed on an object requiring the specified relation will be permitted.

The Evaluator has two parts. The `REQUEST` part on the left is where you specify information about the action being performed, while the "OUTPUT:" on the right displays the body of the request as well as the response.

The table below explains the selection fields.

|Field|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Subject|Which user is performing the action. For Simple RBAC there are 5 users that you can select from|
|Object Type|What type of object is the action performed on|
|Object|Which object of the selected Object Type will the action be perform on|
|Relation|Which relation or permission is required|

## Testing the policy

Now let's check a few different scenarios using the Evalator. First, a few important things to note about Rick and Morty:

* Morty is an Owner for the mega-seed object. This means he has the `can_read`, `can_write`, and `can_delete` permission which correspond to using, changing, or destorying the mega-seed.  
* Rick is a Viewer for the mega-seed object. This means he only has the `can_read` permission.

### Scenario 1 - Morty can use the `mega-seed?

* For Subject, select "Morty Smith"
* For Object Type, select "mega-seed"
* For Relation, select "can-read"
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": true` under results indicating the action will be permitted.

### Scenario 2 - Rick can use the `mega-seed?

* For Subject, select "Rick Sanchez"
* For Object Type, select "mega-seed"
* For Relation, select "can-read"
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": true` under results indicating the action will be permitted.

### Scenario 3 - Morty can change the `mega-seed`

* For Subject, select "Morty Smith"
* For Object Type, select "mega-seed"
* For Relation, select "can-write"
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": true` under results indicating the action will be permitted.

### Scenario 4 - Rick cannot change the `mega-seed`

* For Subject, select "Morty Smith"
* For Object Type, select "mega-seed"
* For Relation, select "can-write"
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": false` under results indicating the action will be permitted.

### Scenario 5 - Morty can destroy the `mega-seed`

* For Subject, select "Morty Smith"
* For Object Type, select "mega-seed"
* For Relation, select "can-delete"
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": true` under results indicating the action will be permitted.

### Scenario 6 - Rick cannot destroy the `mega-seed`

* For Subject, select "Rick Sanchez"
* For Object Type, select "mega-seed"
* For Relation, select "can-delete"
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": false` under results indicating the action will be denied.

## Next steps

Now that you have seen how the policy works, you'll use the Quickstart in the console to install the sample application make requests to the API which is bound to the simple-rbac policy instance.

Click on the "Quickstart" tab on the left.
