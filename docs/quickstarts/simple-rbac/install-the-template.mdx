# Install the Simple RBAC template

To use Simple RBAC the first thing you need to do is install the Simple RBAC template. This will accomplish the following

* Create a simple-rebac policy instance which uses the Simple RBAC policy and contains the Simple RBAC Quickstart
* Install the Citadel Demo IDP which is based on Rick & Morty and contains 5 users.
* Install the Citadel Data which contains several objects along with permissions, groups, roles, and relations.

## Installation

From the Console, click on the `Policies` tab. This will display the list of available Policy instances. Click on the `Create an instance` button in the upper right corner.

A create policy instance screen will be displayed with a list of options. Click on "...by instantiating a template".

Next you'll see the available templates that you can apply. Select `Simple RBAC` and click the `Apply template` button.

You'll now see a popup warning that all directory data will be removed. When you install a template all existing directory data is removed. _If you previously connected your own identity providers or manually added any data, then it will be erased. The data from the identity providers will be reimported but manual data will be lost.  To proceed, click the `Delete Data` button.

Once the template has finished installing, you will be taken back to the `Policy instances` screen where you can see the new `simple-rbac` instance has been created. Notice that it relies on the `policy-rebac` image, which is possible because RBAC can be expressed via relationships.  Click on it.

## Next Steps

You can now see the `simple-rbac` evaluator which you will use in the next topic to test out your policy.
