# Install the Simple RBAC backend

Now that you have tested out the policy the next step is to install locally the sample back-end that is included with this sample. It contains an API for interacting with the Citadel resources and is protected by the `simple-rbac` policy instance hosted in Aserto that we just tested.

From the Quickstart screen scroll to Step 2 "Download the back-end" and click on the `Download back-end button"

## Select the Language

This will bring up a language selector. You can choose from the available languages.

We'll choose `Node.JS` but any language will work. Click on the `Node.JS` icon and the instructions for downloading and installing will appear.

## Download and install

Click the download button. Once the download is finished, follow the rest of the directions to install dependencies and start the server. 

## Next steps

Now that the server is running, you'll use the Quickstart to test out accessing the API. Click on the "x" in the corner to close the Download screen and return to the Quickstart.
