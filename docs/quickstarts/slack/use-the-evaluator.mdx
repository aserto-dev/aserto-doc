# Use the Slack Evaluator

Now that you have created your policy instance, you can test it out with the Evaluator. The Evaluator supports several requests, corresponding to Aserto's authorization APIs - `is`, `decisiontree`, and `query`. The default "Check" request, however, is specifically designed for `policy-rebac`.  Using the Evaluator allows you to quickly verify whether a user has a relationship (or permission) on an object.

The Evaluator has two parts. The `REQUEST` part on the left is where you specify information about the action being performed, while the `OUTPUT` on the right displays the body of the request as well as the response.

The table below explains the selection fields.

|Field|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Subject|The user to evaluate. For Slack there are 5 Citadel users that you can select from.|
|Object Type|The type of object to evaluate. For Slack this will be `Channel`.|
|Object|The object instance to evaluate.|
|Relation|Which relation or permission to evaluate.|

## Testing the policy

Now let's check a few different scenarios using the Evalator. First, a few important things to note about Rick and Morty:

* Rick is a `channel_admin` of the `smiths` workspace. This means he has the `can_read`, `can_write`, `can_comment`, and `can_delete` permission on any channel within that workspace, including the `general`, `citadel`, and `gossip` channels.
* Morty is a `member` of the `smiths` workspace. Every member of that workspace is a `writer` on the `gossip` channel. In addition, Morty is also explicitly a `writer` on the `citadel` channel, so he has the `can_read`, `can_write`, and `can_comment` permissions on both channels. However, Morty has no permissions on the `general` channel.

### Scenario 1 - can Rick read the `citadel` channel?

* For Subject, select "Rick Sanchez".
* For Object Type, select "Channel".
* For Object, select "citadel".
* For Relation, select "can-read".
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": true` under results indicating the action will be permitted.

### Scenario 2 - can Rick delete the `general` channel?

* For Subject, select "Rick Sanchez".
* For Object Type, select "Channel".
* For Object, select "general".
* For Relation, select "can-delete".
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": true` under results indicating the action will be permitted.

### Scenario 3 - can Morty write the `citadel` channel?

* For Subject, select "Morty Smith".
* For Object Type, select "Channel".
* For Object, select "citadel".
* For Relation, select "can-write".
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": true` under results indicating the action will be permitted.

### Scenario 4 - can Morty write the `general` channel?

* For Subject, select "Morty Smith".
* For Object Type, select "Channel".
* For Object, select "general".
* For Relation, select "can-write".
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": false` under results indicating the action will be denied.

### Scenario 5 - can Morty write the `gossip` channel?

* For Subject, select "Morth Smith".
* For Object Type, select "Channel".
* For Object, select "general".
* For Relation, select "can-write".
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": true` under results indicating the action will be permitted.

## Next steps

Now that you have seen how the policy works, you'll use the Quickstart in the console to download and run the sample back-end API, which uses the `slack` policy for access control.

Click on the "Quickstart" tab on the left.
