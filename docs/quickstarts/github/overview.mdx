# GitHub Quickstart

The GitHub scenario is an example of how to implement an authorization policy using a hierarchical, nested relationship-based access control (ReBAC) model.

The GitHub Quickstart includes:
* A domain model for GitHub, including `folder` and `doc` object types, `owner`, `editor`, and `viewer` relationships, and `can_read`, `can_write`, `can_share`, and `can_delete` permissions.
* A policy instance called `github` which uses a boilerplate authorization policy called `policy-rebac`. This policy simply uses the underlying relationships to determine access.
* A connection to the **Citadel Demo IDP**, which contains five demo users based on the Rick & Morty cartoon.
* Sample *resources*, including folders such as `Rick's Home Folder` and `Morty's Shared Folder`, and documents such as `Grocery list` and `Rick's inventions`. Rick & Morty have `owner`, `writer`, and `reader` *relationships* to these resources, demonstrating a relationship-based (ReBAC) model.
* A back-end API that uses the `github` policy for authorization, implemented in several languages.
* An interactive tutorial which helps construct `curl` requests to test the back-end API.

As you go through the Quickstart, you'll learn the following:
* How to instantiate the GitHub template.
* How to browse the directory and examine the manifest.
* How to evaluate policy decisions within the Aserto Evaluator.
* How to download and run the GitHub back-end API.
* How to construct `curl` requests to the back-end in order to test out the API.

## Prerequisites
To follow this Quickstart you'll need to have an Aserto account. If you do not have one, you can create one [here](https://www.aserto.com/#signup). Once you have created your tenant, you can continue.
