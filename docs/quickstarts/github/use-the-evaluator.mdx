# Use the GitHub Evaluator

Now that you have created your policy instance, you can test it out with the Evaluator. The Evaluator supports several requests, corresponding to Aserto's authorization APIs - `is`, `decisiontree`, and `query`. The default "Check" request, however, is specifically designed for `policy-rebac`.  Using the Evaluator allows you to quickly verify whether a user has a relationship (or permission) on an object.

The Evaluator has two parts. The `REQUEST` part on the left is where you specify information about the action being performed, while the `OUTPUT` on the right displays the body of the request as well as the response.

The table below explains the selection fields.

|Field|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Subject|The user to evaluate. For GitHub there are 5 Citadel users that you can select from.|
|Object Type|The type of object to evaluate. For GitHub this will be `Repo`.|
|Object|The object instance to evaluate.|
|Relation|Which relation or permission to evaluate.|

## Testing the policy

Now let's check a few different scenarios using the Evalator. First, a few important things to note about Rick and Morty:

* Both Rick and Morty are a `repo_admin` of the `citadel` organization. This means both of them have the `can_read`, `can_triage`, `can_write`, `can_maintain`, `can_delete`, and `can_administer` permissions on every `repo` for which the `citadel` organization is the `owner`. This includes the `citadel.missions` repo.
* Morty is a `repo_reader` of the `smiths` organization. This means he only has the `can_read` permission on the organization and on any `repo` that is owned by the `smiths` organization, which includes the `smiths.budget` repo.

### Scenario 1 - can Morty administer the `smiths.budget` repo?

* For Subject, select "Morty Smith".
* For Object Type, select "Repo".
* For Object, select "The Smith's budget repository".
* For Relation, select "can-administer".
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": false` under results indicating the action will be denied.

### Scenario 2 - can Morty read the `smiths.budget` repo?

* For Subject, select "Morty Smith".
* For Object Type, select "Repo".
* For Object, select "The Smith's budget repository".
* For Relation, select "can-read".
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": true` under results indicating the action will be permitted.

### Scenario 3 - can Rick read the `smiths.budget` repo?

* For Subject, select "Rick Sanchez".
* For Object Type, select "Repo".
* For Object, select "The Smith's budget repository".
* For Relation, select "can-read".
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": false` under results indicating the action will be denied.

### Scenario 4 - can Rick write the `citadel.missions` repo?

* For Subject, select "Rick Sanchez".
* For Object Type, select "Repo".
* For Object, select "The citadel missions repository".
* For Relation, select "can-write".
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": true` under results indicating the action will be permitted.

### Scenario 5 - can Morty delete the `citadel.missions` repo?

* For Subject, select "Morty Smith".
* For Object Type, select "Repo".
* For Object, select "The citadel missions repository".
* For Relation, select "can-delete".
* Click the `Play` button.
* You should see `"is": true` under results indicating the action will be permitted.

## Next steps

Now that you have seen how the policy works, you'll use the Quickstart in the console to download and run the sample back-end API, which uses the `github` policy for access control.

Click on the "Quickstart" tab on the left.
