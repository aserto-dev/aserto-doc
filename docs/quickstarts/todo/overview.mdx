# Todo Quickstart

The Todo Quickstart includes:
* a Todo front-end, written in React.
* a Todo back-end, implemented in a few languages.
* an interactive tutorial to learn about how the Todo policy works.

As you go through the Quickstart, you'll learn the following:
* How to write a simple authorization policy using Rego, Aserto's policy language
* How to integrate Aserto into a backend in the language of your choice

## Prerequisites
To follow this Quickstart you'll need to have an Aserto account. If you do not have one, you can create one following the directions [here](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/create-account). Once you have created your tenant, you can continue.

## Navigate to Todo Policy Instance Details

New Aserto accounts automatically provision the Todo policy instance. In the Policies tab, click the `todo` policy to navigate to its details page.

This should put you in the Evaluator for the Todo policy. Go to [Click the Quickstart tab](#click-the-quickstart-tab) for the next steps.

## Or, Create the Todo Policy

If you've created a new organization, or have deleted the Todo policy, you can easily create it with the following steps:
1. Click the "Create an instance" button on the Policies tab (near the top right in the screenshot above).
2. Select "from a sample image".

3. Select `policy-todo` from the dropdown, and the `latest` tag.

  <img src="/todo/create-policy-todo.png" width="600px"/>


This should put you in the Evaluator for the Todo policy. 

## Click the Quickstart tab

Click the Quickstart tab in the left navigation bar. This will bring up the Todo Quickstart.

## Connect the Citadel IDP

The Todo application is built around a set of sample users, modeled after Rick & Morty. The Citadel identity provider (IDP) contains these users. If the Citadel IDP is not already connected, click the "Connect" button.

## Next steps

Next, we'll [download](/docs/quickstarts/todo/download-backend), install, and run the backend in the language of your choice.
