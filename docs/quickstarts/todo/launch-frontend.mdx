# Launch Frontend

Once the backend is running, the frontend can be launched and will be able to connect to your backend.

Click the "Launch front-end" button and then the "Launch" button in the instruction modal.

Note the frontend is stateless and assumes that the backend service is running on http://localhost:3001. 

If the backend isn't running, you'll get an error to that effect.

## Test the application

Follow the instructions and test the application using a set of users that have been made available in the Citadel demo identity provider (Rick, Morty, and so on).

You'll see how users can create, edit and delete todo entries. Depending on their _role_, users may or may not be able to update or delete todo entries they didn't create themselves.

## Policy tutorial

Finally, you'll learn how the Todo policy works from the [policy tutorial](/docs/quickstarts/todo/todo-policy-tutorial).
