# Support more roles

So far, we have defined rules that support a single role - `admin`. We’ll now expand our policy to cover more roles by adding a data file to our policy bundle. In addition to policy Rego files, we can add JSON files that the policy can refer to in runtime.

We'll open the local copy of the _policy_ we cloned before. Directly under the `src` folder, create a new file and name it `data.json` and add the following contents:

```javascript
{
  "roles": {
    "viewer": {
      "description": "A viewer with no access to sensitive asset",
      "perms": {
        "asertodemo.GET.api.protected": {
          "allowed": false
        }
      }
    },
    "editor": {
      "description": "A editor with access to sensitive asset",
      "perms": {
        "asertodemo.GET.api.protected": {
          "allowed": true
        }
      }
    },
    "admin": {
      "description": "An admin user with access to sensitive asset",
      "perms": {
        "asertodemo.GET.api.protected": {
          "allowed": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In order to reference the data file in our policy, we’ll update our policy file:

```
package asertodemo.GET.api.protected

import input.policy.path
import input.user.attributes.roles as user_roles


default allow = false

allowed {
	some index
	data.roles[user_roles[index]].perms[path].allowed
}
```

We have two import statements: one for referencing the policy path (`asertodemo.GET.api.protected`) and one to reference the user roles that are a part of the user object.
The Rego rule declared here will:

1. Iterate over all the user roles (using the `some index` expression and the `user_roles[index]` expression)
2. For each of them, it’ll refer back to the `data.json` file and attempt to find the corresponding entry (e.g., `viewer`, `editor`, `admin` under `roles`
3. Once found, it’ll attempt to resolve the path `perms['asertodemo.GET.api.protected'].allowed` for that role and return the value.
   So, for example, the resolution for the `viewer` role would be `data.json` -> `roles` -> `viewer` -> `perms` -> `asertodemo.GET.api.protected` -> `allowed` -> `false`.

## Update the `.manifest` file

To allow for the use of `roles` in the `data.json` file, update your `.manifest` file:

```
{
    "roots": ["asertodemo", "roles"]
}
```

Commit, tag and push the changes you made:

```
git add .
git commit -m "added data.json file"
git push
git tag v0.0.2
git push --tags
```

In the Aserto console, open the Policies tab, click on the `aserto-react` instance and open the Policy Browser. Check that the changes you’ve made are reflected:

## Test the application

With the new changes to the policy, we can now test a user with the role of `editor` to make sure they can indeed access the protected resource. Log in using the email `dianet@acmecorp.com` (who has the `editor` role) using the password `V@erySecre#t123!`.

![diant-gets-sensitive-infromation](/quickstart-react-and-node/diant-gets-sensitive-infromation.png)

Success! As expected, this user can access the protected resource.

# Checkpoint

So far, we created a simple React application and a simple Express.js application, using OICD as an identity provider. We then set up an Aserto Policy to limit user access to a protected resource using the identity context passed from the React Application. Finally, we saw how to make changes to the policy without requiring any changes to the application code.

In the [next section](conditional-ui-rendering), we’ll learn how to conditionally render UI components based on policy decisions.
