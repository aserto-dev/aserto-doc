# Service Setup

To get started, let's create a new folder called `service` under the React application folder. `cd` into the folder and run:

```
yarn init -y
yarn add express express-jwt jwks-rsa cors express-jwt-aserto dotenv
```

To the `.env` file we created previously, we'll add the following:

```
JWKS_URI=https://acmecorp.demo.aserto.com/dex/keys
ISSUER=https://acmecorp.demo.aserto.com/dex
AUDIENCE=acmecorp-app
```

In the `service` folder, Create a file called `api.js` - that will be our server. To this file, we'll add the following dependencies:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config()
const express = require('express')
const jwt = require('express-jwt')
const jwksRsa = require('jwks-rsa')
const cors = require('cors')
const app = express()
```

In the next section we define the middleware function which will call our identity provider to verify the validity of the JWT (and also enable CORS): Express.js will pass the call to the `checkJwt` middleware which will determine whether the JWT sent to it is valid or not. If it is not valid, Express.js will return a 403 (Forbidden) response.

```javascript
//Paste after the dependencies

const checkJwt = jwt({
  // Dynamically provide a signing key based on the kid in the header and the signing keys provided by the JWKS endpoint
  secret: jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret({
    cache: true,
    rateLimit: true,
    jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,
    jwksUri: process.env.JWKS_URI,
  }),

  // Validate the audience and the issuer
  audience: process.env.AUDIENCE,
  issuer: process.env.ISSUER,
  algorithms: ['RS256'],
})
```

Lastly, we set up a protected route which will use the `checkJwt` middleware:

```javascript
// Enable CORS
app.use(cors())

// Protected API endpoint
app.get('/api/protected', checkJwt, function (req, res) {
  //send the response
  res.json({
    secretMessage: 'Here you go, very sensitive information for ya!',
  })
})

// Launch the API Server at localhost:8080
app.listen(8080)
```

Awesome! our service will be listening on port 8080 and we set up a protected endpoint. In the [next section](update-the-application) we'll test this endpoint by updating our application to send a JWT token.
