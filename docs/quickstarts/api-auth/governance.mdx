# Governance

Before we wrap up, it’s worth noting that with the ReBAC model, we can now trivially find out which users are able to invoke which endpoints.

## Finding endpoints that a user can invoke

Go back to the Aserto Console, click on the Directory tab, and the [Evaluator](https://console.aserto.com/ui/directory/evaluator). Select the request called “Find objects that a user can access”, and select *Beth*, the *Endpoint* type, and the `can_invoke` permission.

Clicking the “Play” button invokes the query, and shows that Beth can only invoke the three GET endpoints on the Todo API service.

This makes sense because she’s a member of the `viewer-group`, and doesn’t have any additional entitlements. Play around with other users such as *Morty* and *Rick* to get different results, and feel free to copy the request as a cURL and execute it from a terminal to see how to invoke this type of request as a REST call.

```sh
curl 'https://directory.prod.aserto.com/api/v3/directory/graph/endpoint/can_invoke/user?object_id=&subject_id=beth%40the-smiths.com' \
          -H 'aserto-tenant-id: <your-tenant-id>' \
          -H 'authorization: basic <your-dir-api-key>' \
          -H 'content-type: application/json'
```

## Finding users that can invoke an endpoint

Lastly, we can ask the question in the opposite direction - which users can invoke an endpoint? Select the “Find users that can access an object” request, select the first endpoint (`DELETE /v1/todos/{todoId}`), and select the `can_invoke` permission. You should see only a single user - *Rick* - that is entitled to invoke that endpoint.

## Wrap-up

This tutorial covered a lot of ground - the API Authorization model, importing an OpenAPI spec, entitling users on services and endpoints, calling Aserto / Topaz from an API gateway, and answering governance questions.

This is only the tip of the iceberg, but should hopefully show the potential of setting up a scalable way to perform fine-grained API authorization for all your services, enforced at the API gateway.

Aserto has a CLI toolchain that enables organizations to easily onboard a new service from its OpenAPI spec, creating the possibility of a CI/CD pipeline that easily adds new services (or handles adding new endpoints) in an automated fashion.

Entitling users to endpoints can be done by adding users to IDP groups (which are imported into Aserto), and break-the-glass scenarios can be achieved in the Aserto Console, through the aserto/topaz CLI, through the REST or gRPC APIs, or one of our [language SDKs](/docs/software-development-kits/overview.mdx).
