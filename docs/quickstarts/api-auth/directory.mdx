# The API Authorization model

Click the [Directory](https://console.aserto.com/ui/directory/model) tab, and the `Edit manifest` button. This will show you the API Authorization model definition. The important type definitions are for *service* and *endpoint*.

## Model

<img src= "/quickstart-api-auth/api-auth-4-model.png" />

```yaml
types:
  # user represents a user that can be granted role(s)
  user:
    relations:
      manager: user

    permissions:
      ### display_name: user#in_management_chain ###
      in_management_chain: manager | manager->in_management_chain

  # group represents a collection of users and/or (nested) groups
  group:
    relations:
      member: user | group#member

  # identity represents a collection of identities for users
  identity:
    relations:
      identifier: user

  # service represents a set of endpoints
  service:
    relations:
      owner: user
      deleter: user | group#member
      creator: user | group#member
      writer: user | group#member
      reader: user | group#member

    permissions:
      can_get: reader | can_put
      can_put: writer | can_post
      can_patch: writer | can_post
      can_post: creator | can_delete
      can_delete: deleter | owner

  # endpoint represents a specific API endpoint
  endpoint:
    relations:
      # each endpoint picks the reader/writer/creator/deleter relation to the service
      # based on the method (GET -> reader, PUT/PATCH -> writer, etc)
      service-reader: service
      service-writer: service
      service-creator: service
      service-deleter: service
      # invoker allows a user or group to get access to invoke this specific endpoint
      invoker: user | group#member
    permissions:
      can_invoke: invoker | service-reader->can_get | service-writer->can_put |
        service-creator->can_post | service-deleter->can_delete
```

Let’s start at the bottom. An endpoint has a `can_invoke` permission, which is directly assignable by creating an `invoker` relationship to a `user` or a `group`. This allows an API administrator to entitle a user or a group directly on a discrete endpoint.

The endpoint also has relations called `service-reader`, `service-writer`, `service-creator`, and `service-deleter` which ladder up to the enclosing `service`. The default transformation that occurs when importing an OpenAPI definition is to set the relationship of the endpoint based on its HTTP method - a `GET` creates the `service-reader` relation, a `PUT` or `PATCH` creates the `service-writer` relation, a `POST` uses the `service-creator` relation, and a `DELETE` uses the `service-deleter` relation. This allows the `can_invoke` permission to ALSO be assignable via relationships that a user or group has to the service. You can of course customize this default transform if you have different conventions or needs.

Now, let’s look at the `service` type. A `service` has discrete permissions called `can_get`, `can_put`, `can_patch`, `can_post`, and `can_delete` which are assignable through the `reader`, `writer`, `creator`, `deleter`, and `owner` relations on the service. These permissions are additive, in the sense that a `deleter` can invoke `DELETE` endpoints, and can also do anything that a `creator` can do. A `creator` can `POST`, and can also do anything that a `writer` can do... and so on.

To put it all together, `users` (or groups) can be entitled at the level of an entire `service`, at the level of a class of `endpoints` on a `service` (e.g. all `GET` endpoints), or at the level of a discrete `endpoint`. This provides a lot of flexibility in API entitlement, while keeping things simple and consistent.

Next, let’s look at the `user`, `group`, `service`, and `endpoint` instance data.

## Authorization data

Click on the Objects tab, and within that the [Service](https://console.aserto.com/ui/directory/objects/service) type. You should see the three services that were automatically added by the template.

<img src= "/quickstart-api-auth/api-auth-5-services.png" />

Let’s follow the trail of entitlements from users and groups to the services and endpoints. Click on the [User](https://console.aserto.com/ui/directory/objects/user) type, which should show the five Citadel users - *Beth*, *Jerry*, *Morty*, *Rick*, and *Summer*.

Let’s click on *Rick*. As you can see, *Rick* is a member of the `Global Deleters` group.

<img src= "/quickstart-api-auth/api-auth-6-rick.png" width="75%" />

Next, click on the [Global Deleters](https://console.aserto.com/ui/directory/objects/group/global-deleters/graph) group.

<img src= "/quickstart-api-auth/api-auth-7-global-deleters.png" />

This group aggregates the `deleters` group for each service. This pattern makes *Rick* a super-user - he can invoke any endpoint in the system, since the members of the `Petstore API Deleters`, `Rick and Morty API Deleters`, and `Todo API Deleters` groups can invoke any endpoint on the respective services, and being a member of the `Global Deleters` group means that Rick is transitively a member of these groups.

Next, let’s look at *Morty* - click the User type and then click [Morty](https://console.aserto.com/ui/directory/objects/user/morty%40the-citadel.com/graph). Morty is a member of the `Petstore API Creators` group, which means he can invoke any `Petstore` endpoint that is not a `DELETE`. This demonstrates the pattern of how to entitle a user on a set of methods within a service.

<img src= "/quickstart-api-auth/api-auth-8-morty.png" />

Finally, let’s go back to the `Service` type and click the [Todo List API](https://console.aserto.com/ui/directory/objects/service/todo/graph). This shows the six endpoints that are part of this API.

<img src= "/quickstart-api-auth/api-auth-9-todo.png" />

The group called `Todo List API Readers` is a `reader` of the service, meaning every member is entitled to invoke all the `GET` endpoints on this service. Click on the [Todo List API Readers](https://console.aserto.com/ui/directory/objects/group/todo-readers/graph), and follow the trail of nested groups. As you can see, it includes the `viewer-group`, which comes from the Citadel IDP.

<img src= "/quickstart-api-auth/api-auth-10-todo-readers.png" />

Clicking the [viewer-group](https://console.aserto.com/ui/directory/objects/group/viewer/graph) reveals its members - *Beth* and *Jerry*, as well as the members of the `editor-group`. Clicking the [editor-group](https://console.aserto.com/ui/directory/objects/group/editor/graph) reveals its members -  *Morty* and *Summer*, as well as members of the `admin-group`. And the [admin-group](https://console.aserto.com/ui/directory/objects/group/admin/graph) includes *Rick*. So, transitively, every one of our protagonists are entitled to invoke any `GET` endpoint on the `Todo API Service`.

This pattern shows how to use nested groups in the IDP to control entitlements to classes of endpoints (in this case, the `GET` endpoints) in a service.

## Next steps

Now that we understand the model and the instance data (services, endpoints, groups, entitlements), let's turn our attention to how to integrate the authorization model with an API gateway.
