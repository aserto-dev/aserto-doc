---

# Overview

When testing out Aserto Quickstart APIs such as Todo or Simple RBAC, you will often need multiple Citadel [JWTs](https://jwt.io/introduction) for different users. Aserto provides an API for creating Citadel tokens which can easily be invoked via `curl`.


# Creating a token
To create a token use the following format:

```ssh
curl -X POST \
  --url https://aserto-console-backend.eng.aserto.com/api/v1/dex/token \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"username": "<email>",
	"password": "<password>"
}'
```

The response will contain a JSON which contains an access token and an ID token. You'll want to use the access token.

```ssh
{"access_token":"eyJh...","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":86399,"id_token":"eyJh..."}
```

# Example

As an example, assume we we want to test out the `resource` API from the Simple RBAC and see if Morty is able to delete a mega-seed. 

## Create the token

First we'll issue the curl to create Rick's token

```ssh
curl -X POST \
  --url https://aserto-console-backend.eng.aserto.com/api/v1/dex/token \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"username": "morty@the-citadel.com",
	"password": "V@erySecre#t123!"
}'
```

We'll get back a response similar to the following with the token.

```ssh
{"access_token":"eyJ...","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":86399,"id_token":"eyJ..."}
```

## Use the token

Copy the access_token and use it with the DELETE `curl` request.

```
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/resource/mega-seed \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ...'
```

You should receive the following response indicating the request was successful.

```ssh
Hello from DELETE /resource/mega-seed
```
