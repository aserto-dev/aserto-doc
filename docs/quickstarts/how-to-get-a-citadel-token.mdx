# Creating Citadel JWTs

## Overview 
When testing out the sample applications included as part of the Todo or Simple RBAC quickstarts, you will need to pass in an authorization header with a [JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction) for the user. These samples all use the **Citadel Demo IDP**, which contains five users based on the Rick & Morty cartoon. Aserto provides an API for creating Citadel access tokens, which can easily be invoked via `curl`.

## Creating a token
To create a token use the following curl:

```ssh
curl -X POST \
  --url https://aserto-console-backend.eng.aserto.com/api/v1/dex/token \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"username": "<email>",
	"password": "<password>"
}'
```

The JSON response contains an access token and an ID token. You'll want to use the access token.

```ssh
{"access_token":"eyJh...","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":86399,"id_token":"eyJh..."}
```

:::tip
On a Mac, you can automatically copy the token into the clipboard, by using the `jq` and `pbcopy` commands. If you do not have `jq` you can install it using `brew` or follow the instructions [here](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/). Then use the following `curl`:

```ssh
curl -X POST \
  --url https://aserto-console-backend.eng.aserto.com/api/v1/dex/token \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"username": "<email>",
	"password": "<password>"
}' | jq -r '.access_token' | pbcopy
```
:::

## Example

As an example, assume we we want to test out the `resource` API in the Simple RBAC demo application, and see if Morty is able to delete a `mega-seed`.

### Creating the token

First we'll issue the curl to create Morty's token:

```ssh
curl -X POST \
  --url https://aserto-console-backend.eng.aserto.com/api/v1/dex/token \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"username": "morty@the-citadel.com",
	"password": "V@erySecre#t123!"
}'
```

We'll get back a response similar to the following with the token.

```ssh
{"access_token":"eyJ...","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":86399,"id_token":"eyJ..."}
```

### Using the token

Copy the `access_token` and use it with the DELETE `curl` request.

```
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/resource/mega-seed \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ...'
```

You should receive the following response indicating the request was successful.

```ssh
Hello from DELETE /resource/mega-seed
```
