title: Defining Types
---

The first step is to create the types we need to model departments and roles. We will define one _object type_ called
`department` from which we can later create instances of `department` objects.

We will also define three _relations_ on the `department` object type&mdash;`owner`, `member`, and `viewer`&mdash;one for each of
the three roles that users can have.

## Object Type

We use the [`setObjectType`](/docs/directory-api-reference/schema/object-types/mutations/set-object-type) mutation to create a new
object type called "department".

```graphql title="Query"
mutation CreateDepartmentObjectType {
  setObjectType(type: {
    name: "department"
    displayName: "Department"
    isSubject: false
    ordinal: 0
    status: []
  }) {
    objectType {
      name
      displayName
      isSubject
      ordinal
      status
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Results</summary>
  <div><span/>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "setObjectType": {
      "objectType": {
        "name": "department",
        "displayName": "Department",
        "isSubject": false,
        "ordinal": 0,
        "status": []
      }
    }
  }
}
```
  </div>
</details>

The value of the `name` field is used to identify the object type and must be unique among all object types in the directory.

The input fields are described in more detail [here](/docs/directory-api-reference/schema/object-types/inputs/set-object-type-input).

### Querying Object Types

To see that the department object types was indeed created, we can enumerate object types using the
[objectTypes](/docs/directory-api-reference/schema/object-types/queries/object-types) query.

The following query retrieves the `name` and `displayName` fields of the first 10 object types that are not subject
_and_ have an no modifier flags in their `status` field:

```graphql title="Query"
query ListObjectTypes {
  objectTypes(first: 10, where: {isSubject: false, status: {equals: []}}) {
    nodes {
      name
      displayName
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Results</summary>
  <div><span/>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "objectTypes": {
      "nodes": [
        {
          "name": "department",
          "displayName": "Department"
        },
        {
          "name": "application",
          "displayName": "Application"
        },
        {
          "name": "resource",
          "displayName": "Resource"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
  </div>
</details>


## Relation Types

Now that we have created an object type, we can define relations that it can have with other objects.

We define three relations, `viewer`, `member`, and `owner`, to represent the three roles that users can have in a
department.

### Viewer

We'll start witht the `viewer` relation.


```graphql title="Query"
mutation CreateDepartmentViewerRelationType {
  setRelationType(type: {
    objectType: {name: "department"}
    name: "viewer",
    displayName: "department:viewer"
    ordinal: 1,
    status: []
    unions: []
  }) {
    relationType {
      name
      displayName
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Results</summary>
  <div><span/>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "setRelationType": {
      "relationType": {
        "name": "viewer",
        "displayName": "department:viewer"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
  </div>
</details>

We specify the object type on which the relation can occur using the `objectType` field.

The `name` field of relation types needs to be unique among all relation types defined on the same object type.

By convention, the `displayName` of relation types is set to `<object type name>:<relation type name>`.

The input fields are described in more detail
[here](/docs/directory-api-reference/schema/relation-types/inputs/set-relation-type-input).


### Member and Owner

A single GraphQL request can include multiple queries and mutations. We'll create the `member` and `owner` relation
types in a single request:

```graphql title="Query"
mutation CreateDepartmentMemberAndOwnerRelationTypes {
  member: setRelationType(type: {
    name: "member",
    displayName: "department:member"
    objectType: {name: "department"}
    ordinal: 1,
    status: []
    unions: []
  }) {
    relationType {
      name
    }
  }

  owner: setRelationType(type: {
    name: "owner",
    displayName: "department:owner"
    objectType: {name: "department"}
    ordinal: 1,
    status: []
    unions: []
  }) {
    relationType {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Results</summary>
  <div><span/>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "member": {
      "relationType": {
        "name": "member"
      }
    },
    "owner": {
      "relationType": {
        "name": "owner"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
  </div>
</details>

:::info
When sending multiple instances of the same query or mutation in a single request, we need to provide them with
_aliases_ to distinguish their respective results in the response's `data` object.

### Querying Relation Types

Let's run a query to see that all three relation types were created as intended.

```graphql title="Query"
query RelationTypes {
  relationTypes(first: 3) {
    nodes {
      name
      displayName
      objectType {
        name
      }
      ordinal
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Results</summary>
  <div><span/>

```json
{
  "data": {
    "relationTypes": {
      "nodes": [
        {
          "name": "viewer",
          "displayName": "department:viewer",
          "objectType": {
            "name": "department"
          },
          "ordinal": 1,
        },
        {
          "name": "member",
          "displayName": "department:member",
          "objectType": {
            "name": "department"
          },
          "ordinal": 1,
        },
        {
          "name": "owner",
          "displayName": "department:owner",
          "objectType": {
            "name": "department"
          },
          "ordinal": 1,
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
  </div>
</details>

:::info
The three relation types we created appear first because we gave them all a low `ordinal` value (i.e. `1`).
Types with lower ordinal values are retruned first. When several types have the same ordinal value, as in our case,
their sort order is arbitrary but stable.
