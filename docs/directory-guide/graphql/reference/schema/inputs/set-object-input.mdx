Input for the setObject mutation.

If `id` is set, the mutation updates an existing object. In this case `type` is optional and if specfied, must match
the type of the existing object.

If `id` is not set then `type` and `key` are required. If an object with the same type and key already exists,
it is updated, otherwise a new object is created.

```graphql
input SetObjectInput {
  id: ID
  type: ObjectTypeSelector!
  key: String!
  displayName: String!
  properties: Map!
  hash: Hash
}
```


### Fields

#### [`id`](#) ([`ID`](/docs/directory-guide/graphql/reference/schema/scalars/id))

ID of an existing object to update. If set, an object with the specified ID must already exist and the mutation
updates its attributes.


#### [`type`](#) ([`ObjectTypeSelector!`](/docs/directory-guide/graphql/reference/schema/inputs/object-type-selector))

The type of object to create or update. If `id` is set, `type` must match the type of the existing object.


#### [`key`](#) ([`String!`](/docs/directory-guide/graphql/reference/schema/scalars/string))

The key of the object to create or update. If `id` is set, `key` is optional and, if specified, replaces the
object' existing key.


#### [`displayName`](#) ([`String!`](/docs/directory-guide/graphql/reference/schema/scalars/string))

Optional display name for a new object or new name for an existing object.


#### [`properties`](#) ([`Map!`](/docs/directory-guide/graphql/reference/schema/scalars/map))

Optional set of JSON properties to be set on the object. If the object already exists, its properties are replaced
by the specified values.


#### [`hash`](#) ([`Hash`](/docs/directory-guide/graphql/reference/schema/scalars/hash))

Optional value of the hash value previously read from the directory.

If a hash value is specified and the object being mutated already exists, the update will be rejected unless the hash
value matches the existing object's hash value.
This can be used to ensure that the object being mutated has not been modified since it was read from the directory.
