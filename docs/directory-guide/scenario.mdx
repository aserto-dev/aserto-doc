This guide walks through an example scenario and demonstrates how the Aserto Directory can be used to implement
multi-tenant Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Consider a simple retail inventory management application. The store consists of multiple departments and different
employees have can have different kinds of roles within each department. The application distinguishes between three
roles:

* `viewer`: Grants read-only access to the department information.
* `member`: In addition to viewer privgileges, members have permission to view all the data, add new products to the
catalog, and set the number of available units on existing products.
* `owner`: Owners have all member privileges and can also delete products and manage user roles in the department.

To model the scenario in the Aserto Directory we will create a new _object type_ called `department`. We will also
create three _relation types_ to represent the `owner`, `member`, and `viewer` roles.

Once the type definitions are in place, we will create a `department` object for each department in the store
and create relations between users and departments to indicate their role membership.


With the directory populated, the application can perform authorization decisions by checking whether a relation
of the right type exists between a user attempting to act on a department and the department object.

In the following pages we'll walk through the process of implementing this data model using the
[Aserto Directory API](directory-api-reference/overview).


You can follow the guide and run the examples against your directory by using the directory's
[GraphiQL Playground](https://directory.prod.aserto.com/graph).
