## Introduction

The Aserto Directory stores information required to make authorization decisions. It is flexible enough to easily
support different access control strategies including Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control
(ABAC), and Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC).

An authorization decision is an answer to the question *"Is subject __S__ allowed to perform action __A__ on resource __R__?"*
In other words, authorization decisions determine whether a subject (user, group, service, etc.) has a given permission on a resource
(document, folder, project, etc.).

The Aserto Directory helps to define policies that make authorization decisions through three main concepts:
* __Object__: Objects represent the participants in authorization decisions. Some objects represent __subjects__&mdash;actors who _perform_
h
actions&mdash;and other may represent __resources__&mdash;the items that subjects can attempt to access in various ways.

* __Permission__: A kind of action that subjects may attempt to perform.

* [__Relation__](relations): A _labeled_ association between a source object and a target object, which may carry with it a set of
_permissions_.

Using these concepts, an authorization decision can be rephrased as *"Does subject __S__ have a relation that carries
permission __P__ with resource __R__?"* A relation between a subject and a resource can be defined explicitly, or be implied from
group membership. For example, the subject __S__ may be a _member_ of group __G__, which in turn has a relation that
carries permission __P__ with the resource __R__.


## Directory as a Graph

It is convenient to think of the Aserto Directory as a graph in which objects are the nodes and relations the edges.
Under this model, the authorization quesion in the previous section can be rephrased again as *"Is there a path from
the node __S__ to the node __R__ in which one or more edges have permission __P__?"*

Indeed, the directory API provides methods to query and traverse this graph of objects and relations.


## Types

To help define different kinds of objects and specify the relations that may exist between them, the Aserto Directory
provides two extensible sets of types:
* __Object Types__ define the kinds of objects that can be created in the directory.
* __Relation Types__ define the kinds of relations that can be created between directory objects.
