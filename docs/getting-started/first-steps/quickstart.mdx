# First Steps

## Overview

This guide will take you through the first steps of using Aserto.

At the end of the process, you will have the following:

- A free Aserto account
- A free organization associated with the account
- A running policy instance
- A running application wired to the policy instance

Please allow about 10 minutes to have it all working end-to-end.

To get started, [create your Aserto account](/docs/getting-started/first-steps/create-account).
