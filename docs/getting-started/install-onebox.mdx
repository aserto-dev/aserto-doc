# Installing a local authorizer running as a docker container

So far, we've only interacted with a multi-tenant hosted version of the Aserto Authorizer. But there are
other deployment models:

- Developing locally against a containerized version of the Aserto Authorizer, referred to as the **Sidecar**
- Deploying the Aserto Authorizer as a sidecar in the same kubernetes pod as the calling service
- Deploying the Aserto Authorizer as another microservice in the same subnet as the other microservices in your application

These scenarios all use the open-source `sidecar` docker image, which is a containerized version of the
Aserto authorization system, which can either be run independently with no connection to the Aserto control
plane, or can be connected to the Aserto control plane to automatically receive policy changes, user attribute
changes, and push decision logs back to the control plane.

:::note
The Sidecar requires `docker` to be installed and running.
To install Docker: `brew install --cask docker`
:::

To get started with the Sidecar, you can pull it down using the Aserto CLI.

If you haven't yet, you can install it using `brew` on Mac or Linux.

```bash
brew tap aserto-dev/tap && brew install aserto
```

:::Note
For Windows (or if you want to download it as a zip file), refer to the [CLI installation page](/docs/command-line-interface/aserto-cli/installation).
:::

Sign in to your Aserto account:

```bash
aserto login
```

You can use the CLI to install and run a local authorizer on your desktop.

The following command will pull down the latest `sidecar` docker image.

```bash
aserto developer install
```

The next command will pull down the configuration for a policy that you've set up in the console, using
the name you gave it (in our case, `peoplefinder`).

```bash
aserto developer configure peoplefinder
```

The following command will `docker run` a local container with the `peoplefinder` policy configuration, writing the decision logs to `/tmp/decision-logs`:

```bash
aserto developer start peoplefinder --data-path=/tmp/decision-logs
```

The next few commands help manage the `sidecar` docker instance and image.

```bash
aserto developer status   # displays the running status of the authorizer
aserto developer stop     # stops the authorizer
aserto developer update   # updates the authorizer image to :latest
```

## Next Steps

Explore how the [PeopleFinder sample](/docs/getting-started/peoplefinder/peoplefinder-overview) uses the Aserto express SDK and React SDK to inject authorization into the applicationâ€™s API, and conditionally render UI elements based on the `visible` and `enabled` attributes of the policy.

Deploy the [self-hosted](/docs/getting-started/self-hosted/helm-chart) authorizer, directory, and a web console to your own kubernetes cluster.
