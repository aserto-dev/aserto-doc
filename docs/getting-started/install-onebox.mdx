# Installing a local Topaz authorizer

So far, we've only interacted with a multi-tenant hosted version of the Aserto Authorizer. But there are other deployment models:

- Developing locally against [Topaz](https://www.topaz.sh), which is a containerized version of the Aserto Authorizer
- Deploying the Topaz Authorizer as a sidecar in the same kubernetes pod as the calling service
- Deploying the Topaz Authorizer as another microservice in the same subnet as the other microservices in your application

These scenarios all use the open-source `topaz` docker image, which is a containerized version of the
Aserto authorization system, which can either be run independently with no connection to the Aserto Control
Plane, or can be connected to the Aserto Control Plane to automatically receive policy changes, directory data 
changes, and push decision logs back to the Control Plane.

:::note
Topaz requires `docker` to be installed and running.
To install Docker: `brew install --cask docker`
:::

To get started with Topaz, you can pull it down using the Aserto CLI.

If you haven't yet, you can install it using `brew` on Mac or Linux.

```bash
brew tap aserto-dev/tap && brew install aserto
```

:::Note
For Windows (or if you want to download it as a zip file), refer to the [CLI installation page](/docs/command-line-interface/aserto-cli/installation).
:::

Sign in to your Aserto account:

```bash
aserto login
```

You can use the CLI to install and run a local Topaz authorizer on your desktop. The following instructions will show you how to create a local configuration of the Aserto policy and directory that you created using the Aserto Console.

## Install Topaz

The following command will pull down the latest `topaz` docker image.

```bash
aserto install
```

## Select the tenant to target

Next, you'll need to select the Aserto tenant that you'd like to target. List the remote configs (tenants):

```bash
aserto config list
```

Then select the tenant you'd like to target:

```bash
aserto config use <your-tenant-name.aserto.com>
```

## Create a Topaz configuration that mirrors a policy

The next command will create a local configuration for a policy that you've set up in the Aserto Console, using the name you gave it (in our case, `peoplefinder`).

```bash
aserto config new --name="peoplefinder"
```

This will create a new local configuration that mirrors the `peoplefinder` instance. You'll need to switch to this config:

```bash
aserto config use peoplefinder
```

:::tip
Refer to the [CLI docs](/docs/command-line-interface/aserto-cli/onebox.mdx) to learn how to create an Edge Authorizer configuration, which will allow this local Topaz instance to be managed by the Aserto Control Plane.
:::

## Start Topaz with the local configuration

The following command will `docker run` a local container with the `peoplefinder` policy configuration:

```bash
aserto start
```

Once Topaz is started, it will pull down the policy and data (if you've configured data syncing) from the instance you configured in the Aserto Console. You now have a local copy running on your own machine!

## Bring up the console

Topaz has a fully featured local console that mirrors the Aserto Console. Use the following command to bring it up in a browser window:

```bash
aserto console
```

## Other commands

The next few commands help manage the `topaz` docker instance and image.

```bash
aserto status   # displays the running status of the topaz authorizer
aserto stop     # stops the topaz authorizer
aserto update   # updates the topaz authorizer image to :latest
```

## Next Steps

Explore how the [PeopleFinder sample](/docs/getting-started/peoplefinder/peoplefinder-overview) uses the Aserto express SDK and React SDK to inject authorization into the applicationâ€™s API, and conditionally render UI elements based on the `visible` and `enabled` attributes of the policy.
