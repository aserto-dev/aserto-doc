# Deploy the PeopleFinder sample to Netlify

To get started let's deploy the PeopleFinder application. In the upper right corner of the Aserto console click on the arrow to bring up the context menu.

Select Quickstarts in the menu. This will bring you to the Aserto Quickstarts screen.

Choose the left sample to deploy using the Acmecop sample IDP. This will bring up the deployment screen and prompt you to connect Acmecorp.

Aserto syncs to an identity provider to pull user information into the Aserto [Directory](/docs/overview/directory). The directory is the source of truth which your applications will use to determine users, roles, groups, and more. Click the "Connect" button.

Aserto relies on [Policies](/docs/overview/policy-lifecycle) for decisions which determine whether or not a user can access a specific resource. Policies are container images containing code files, which are stored in a policy registry and copied into your Aserto organization. Aserto has a public policy registry which contains the policies for PeopleFinder which the Quickstart has connected to.

Now that the registry is connected, the Quickstart will download the PeopleFinder policy image out of the registry and start a policy instance, which the application will be able to connect to for authorization decisions. Click the button to create the instance.

The last step is to start the deployment to Netlify. Click the "Deploy to Netify" button.

Click the "Connect to Github" button to have Netlify connect to your Github account so that it can create a copy of the `peoplefinder-acmecorp` repo.

The next screen is pre-populated with all the configuration information Netlify needs to deploy the site. Click "Save & Deploy" and the deployment will start.

After about two minutes, Netlify should indicate that the deployment was successful. If it is you first Netlify deployment, you'll see "Get started" button.

Click the button, and you will be taken to your live instance of PeopleFinder!
