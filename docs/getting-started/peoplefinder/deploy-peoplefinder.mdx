# Deploy the PeopleFinder sample to Netlify

To get started let's deploy the PeopleFinder application. Click [here](https://console.aserto.com/ui/quickstarts) to be taken to the Quickstarts screen in the Aserto Console.

Choose the left sample to deploy using the Acmecorp sample IDP. This will bring up the deployment screen and prompt you to connect Acmecorp. 

## Connect the "Acmecorp" identity provider

An identity provider is the source of truth for user and group information. Aserto can pull user and group information out of an identity provider and into the Aserto [Directory](/docs/overview/directory), so you can use these users, groups, and relationships between them in your authorization decisions.

The Acmecorp identity provider is a sample IDP that contains around 270 employees of a fictitious company called "Acmecorp", as well as a few groups that they belong to. Click the "Connect" button to connect the Acmecorp IDP to your account and import these users and groups.

## Instantiate the PeopleFinder policy
 
Aserto relies on [Policies](/docs/overview/policy-lifecycle) for decisions which determine whether or not a user can access a specific resource. A policy is written in a language called Rego and built into a policy image (similar to a docker image). Policy images are stored in a policy registry, and can be instantiated as a policy instance. 

Aserto has a public policy registry which contains the policy for PeopleFinder. This public policy registry is already connected to your tenant.

Next, let's instantiate the PeopleFinder policy and name it "peoplefinder-instance" by clicking the "Create" button. This will start a hosted authorizer instance that runs this specific policy. The PeopleFinder application will be able to connect to this authorizer to make authorization decisions.

## Deploy PeopleFinder to Netlify

The last step is to start the deployment of PeopleFinder to Netlify. Click the "Deploy to Netify" button.

This will bring up the Netlify UI on a different browser tab:

Click the "Connect to Github" button to have Netlify connect to your Github account so that it can create a copy of the `peoplefinder-acmecorp` repo.

The next screen is pre-populated with all the configuration information Netlify needs to deploy the site. Click "Save & Deploy" and the deployment will start.

After about two minutes, Netlify should indicate that the deployment was successful. If it is you first Netlify deployment, you'll see "Get started" button.

Otherwise you'll see the "Open production deploy" button.

Click the button, and you will be taken to your live instance of PeopleFinder!

## Congratulations!

You now have a live instance of the PeopleFinder application bound to an Aserto Policy instance running in your Aserto account. Now let's dive in and learn more about the PeopleFinder application.
