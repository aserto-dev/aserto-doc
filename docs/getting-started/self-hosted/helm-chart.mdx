# Deploy Self-Hosted Console to Kubernetes via Helm Chart

## Helm Chart

### Usage
Helm must be installed to use the charts. Please refer to Helmâ€™s documentation to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

```bash
helm repo add aserto https://charts.aserto.com
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve the latest versions of the packages. You can then run `helm search repo aserto` to see the charts.

To install the self-hosted chart:

```bash
helm install my-aserto aserto/self-hosted
```

To uninstall the chart:

```bash
helm delete my-aserto
```

## Using your own database

The helm chart deploys a local postgres deployment by default.  To use your own database you can override configuration.
