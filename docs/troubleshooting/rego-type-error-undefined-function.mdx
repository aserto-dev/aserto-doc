# rego_type_error: undefined function

## Problem

When attempting to build a policy using the CLI, an `undefined function` build error occurs similar to the following:

```sh
policy build . -t glennblock/policy-rebac:1.0.0

build failed: failed to build opa policy bundle: 3 errors occurred:
content/src/policies/rebac.check.rego:14: rego_type_error: undefined function ds.check_relation
content/src/policies/rebac.check_permission.rego:13: rego_type_error: undefined function ds.check_permission
content/src/policies/rebac.check_relation.rego:13: rego_type_error: undefined function ds.check_relation
```

## Solution

This error means that the policy CLI is unable to find the functions that the policy depends on. It usually occurs when the CLI is run out of a directory like the `content` directory, that does not contain the `.manifest`.

:::note
This can also occur if the rego code is referring to functions that do not exist or have been typed incorrectly.
:::

To fix, either change to the directory (`content/src`) where the `.manifest` lives, or pass the directory as the directory argument: `policy build content/src -t glennblock/policy-rebac:1:0.0`
