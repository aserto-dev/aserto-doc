# Overview
ABAC focuses on the use of attributes associated with the subject, resource, or environment to determine whether access to a resource is allowed. While roles are limited due to their static nature, attributes allow a more fine-grained authorization model by incorporating attributes that can have dynamic values. 

User attributes include user-specific information, such as their name, role, team, seniority, projects, and more. Resource attributes include things like the resourceâ€™s owner, creation date, file name, folder, etc. Environmental attributes include data points such as the time of access, the location of the user, and if access is over a public network or VPN.

# Example
A common use of ABAC is in patient-care applications where there are heavy regulations around privacy and data access. An ABAC policy for viewing a patient might limit viewing to only those staff who are in the same department as the patient's doctor, which might be a `user.department` property. Since there can be a large number of doctors and the department list is not fixed, it wouldn't make sense to handle this with roles.


# Pros and Cons
The table below indicates the pros and cons of using an ABAC model

| Pro             | Con            |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Allow much more fine-grained authorization | Requires more up front investment / more work to implement than RBAC |
| Dynamic, and extensible | Difficult to reason since it incorporates dynamic data |
| Offers a large amount of flexibility | Can introduce unwanted behavior if all potential values are not addressed |
