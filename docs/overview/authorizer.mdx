# Authorizer

The Authorizer uses the open source 

Aserto uses [Topaz](https://github.com/aserto-dev/topaz) as its authorizer. It provides a self-contained authorization engine, and includes an embedded implementation of a relationship directory. The Authorizer uses the [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) (OPA) to
compute a [**decision**](/docs/overview/policy#decision) based on a [**policy**](/docs/overview/policy),
[**user context**](/docs/overview/policy#user-context), and [**resource context**](/docs/overview/policy#resource-context).

The Authorizer is packaged as a docker image and is meant to be deployed as close as possible
to your application:

- a sidecar container in the same pod as the application (if you're running in Kubernetes)
- a service that is deployed in the same subnet as your application (if not)

In addition, when you create an Aserto [organization](/docs/overview/organization), a Topaz Authorizer instance is provisioned for you in Aserto's multi-tenant environment. Since the authorizers are the same, using the hosted authorizer is the easiest way to start building applications that use Aserto.

Finally, the same container image underpins Aserto's local developer experience, which you can
deploy on your local workstation using the Aserto [CLI](/docs/command-line-interface/introduction), and
use while developing your application. This helps create a tight development workflow that has no
external dependencies.
