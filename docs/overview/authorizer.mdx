# Authorizer

The Authorizer is the component where authorization decisions are made. This is sometimes known as a Policy Decision Point, or PDP.

Aserto uses the [Topaz](https://github.com/aserto-dev/topaz) open source project as its authorizer.

Topaz provides a self-contained authorization service, and utilizes the [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) (OPA) authorization engine to
compute a [**decision**](/docs/overview/policy#decision) based on a [**policy**](/docs/overview/policy),
[**user context**](/docs/overview/policy#user-context), and [**resource context**](/docs/overview/policy#resource-context).

Topaz also includes an embedded database, which can be used to store a local copy of the data that is used to make an authorization decision.

Because of this design, authorization decisions can be computed over local data, resulting in fast (order of ~1ms) evaluation intervals.

Topaz is packaged as a docker image and is meant to be deployed as close as possible to your application. The most common deployment models are:
- a sidecar container in the same pod as the application.
- a microservice that is deployed in the same cluster or subnet as your application.

In addition, when you create an Aserto [organization](/docs/overview/organization), a Topaz Authorizer instance is provisioned for you in Aserto's multi-tenant environment. Since the authorizers are the same, using the hosted authorizer is the easiest way to start building applications that use Aserto, without having to deploy a Topaz instance on your own computer or cluster.

Finally, the same Topaz container image underpins Aserto's local developer experience, which you can deploy on your local workstation using the Aserto [CLI](/docs/command-line-interface/introduction), and use while developing your application. This helps create a tight development workflow that has no external dependencies.
