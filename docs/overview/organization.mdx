# Aserto Organizations

The organization provides the context for the artifacts that are managed by Aserto -
[_connections_](/docs/overview/connections), [_policies_](/docs/overview/policy-lifecycle), and the [_user directory_](/docs/overview/directory). You can think of it like a GitHub organization.

Every organization has at least one owner. It can also have members and viewers.

## Artifacts

Aserto manages the following artifacts for an organization:

- [Connections](/docs/overview/connections) - these are connections to external systems such as source code control systems and identity providers
- [Policies](/docs/overview/policy-lifecycle) - these are references to git repositories that store authorization policies
- [User Directory](/docs/overview/directory) - these are the users that Aserto has synched from one or more connected identity providers

## Role-based access control

Naturally, Aserto uses Aserto for authorization, using a simple role-based access control (RBAC) model.

The roles that Aserto supports:

- Owner: can perform all operations on an organization, including inviting other viewers, members, and owners, as well as reset the role of another member of the organization
- Member: can perform all operations on an organization except inviting others to the organization or managing organization membership
- Viewer: allowed to see all organization information, but not create or edit any organization artifacts

The Aserto policy for the Aserto API can be found [here](https://github.com/aserto-dev/policy-aona).
