# Control Plane

The Aserto Control Plane manages the lifecycle of **policies**, **user context**, and **data** that are
used by the Authorizer. The control plane makes it easy to manage these artifacts centrally, and
takes care of the details of synchronizing them to the Authorizer instance(s) deployed at the edge.

## Organizations

An Aserto [Organization](/docs/overview/organization) provides the organizational scoping mechanism for artifacts
managed by the Aserto Control Plane. You can think of a organization just like a GitHub organization.

## Artifacts

The artifacts that are managed per-organization are:

- [Connections](/docs/overview/connections): connections to external systems such as identity providers and source code control systems
- [Policies](/docs/overview/policy-lifecycle): references to a set of authorization policy repositories
- [User directory](/docs/overview/directory): the meta-directory that Aserto builds from the identity providers that it is connected to
- [Decision logs](/docs/overview/decision-logs): a centralized log of the aggregated decisions that are made by authorizers
