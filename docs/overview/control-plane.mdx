# Control Plane

The Aserto Control Plane provides a central management layer for Topaz authorizers, and brings three important capabilities:
* **Policy lifecycle management**: facilitating a policy-as-code workflow, and distributing policy changes to Topaz instances in under a second, using an eventing fabric.
* **Directory management**: manifest and data changes to the central directory are distributed to Topaz instances using the same fabric.
* **Decision log aggregation**: decision logs gathered by the Topaz instances are collected and transmitted to the Control Plane using exactly-once, in-order semantics. They are then aggregated into a composite decision log interface, which can be streamed or batched into a customer's logging / SIEM system.

## Control Plane and Edge Authorizers

When a Topaz instance connects to the Control Plane, we call it an [Edge Authorizer](/docs/edge-authorizers/overview.mdx). The Control Plane can relay commands to the edge authorizers that are connected to it. See the [Control Plane Guide](/docs/control-plane-guide/overview.mdx) for more information.
