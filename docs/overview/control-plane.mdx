# Control Plane

The Aserto Control Plane provides a central management layer for Topaz authorizers, and brings three important capabilities:
* Policy lifecycle management: facilitating a policy-as-code workflow, and distributing policy changes to Topaz instances in under a second, using an eventing fabric.
* Directory management: data changes to the central directory are distributed to Topaz instances using the same fabric.
* Decision log aggregation: decision logs gathered by the Topaz instances are collected and transmitted to the control plane using exactly-once, in-order semantics. They are then aggregated into a composite decision log interface, which can be streamed or batched into a customer's logging / SIEM system.

## Tenants

An Aserto tenant provides the scoping and isolation mechanism for artifacts managed by the Aserto Control Plane. There 
are two types of tenants:
* **Accounts**: every user has a personal account, where they can create and manage artifacts
* **Organizations**: users can create an [organization](/docs/overview/organization), invite other users to join, and assign them a role (viewer, member, admin, owner).

:::tip
You can think of an account just like a GitHub account, and an organization just like a GitHub organization.

Each tenant (whether an account or organization) has a unique Tenant ID, which is used by the Aserto CLI to determine which tenant to manage. 
It is also used by client applications to indicate which tenant to interact with.

## Artifacts

The artifacts that are managed per-tenant are:

- [Policy Images](/docs/overview/policy): binary (OCI) images that are built from policy source files, usually sourced from a git repository.
- [Policy Instances](/docs/overview/policy): named instances of a policy image, which can be bound to Topaz instances and transparently distributed when the policy changes. Each policy instance also has a running *hosted authorizer* associated with it, which can be used to evaluate authorization decisions without having to deploy a local Topaz instance.
- [Directory](/docs/overview/directory): the subjects (users, groups) that Aserto has synched from one or more connected identity providers, as well as any custom objects and relationships that are stored centrally and can be transparently distributed to edge authorizers.
- [Decision logs](/docs/overview/decision-logs): each policy instance include the aggregated decision logs that are gathered from the Topaz instances which are configured for that policy instance.
- [Connections](/docs/overview/connections): connections to external systems such as source code control systems and identity providers.
