# Policy Lifecycle

## Policy

At the core of Asertoâ€™s authorization model is an authorization policy, which we refer to simply as a **Policy**. Policies are authored in a textual language called [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/), defined as part of the [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA) project in the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/).

Policies are treated just like application code or infrastructure-as-code - they can be stored as code in a git repository, or as an OCIv2 image in a policy repository (like the Aserto Policy Container Registry or the [Open Policy Registry](https://www.openpolicyregistry.io/)).

## The policy lifecycle

Policies are **authored** using a text / code editor, **built** into an image, **published** to a repository hosted on a registry, **run** in a policy instance, and **consumed** by an application.

Aserto's control plane helps manage the policy lifecycle.

### Author

Policies are comprised of a collection of `.rego` files and `.json` files, which provide static data that can be part of the policy.

### Build, tag and publish Policy images

The set of source files that comprise a policy are built into a **Policy Image** using a set of tools that are modeled after the `docker` toolset. You can build and tag a policy just like you build and tag a docker image.

There are two paths for managing the lifecycle of a policy image:

1. Using the `policy` CLI to build, tag and push a policy image to a policy registry.
2. Using GitHub, a **build action** automatically builds a new version of a policy image when the source repository is **tagged** with a new tag.

### `policy` CLI

#### Login

```bash
policy login -s <PATH-TO-REGISTRY> -u <USERNAME> -p <APCR_API_KEY>
```

To connect to the Aserto Container Registry, use the path `registry.prod.aserto.com`.
The APCR API Key is found in the Connections tab under the "apcr" connection:

#### Build

To build a policy image, use the `policy build` command. Then, tag your built image by using the `policy tag` command.

```bash
policy build . -t my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2
policy tag my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2 my-org/my-policy:latest
```

#### Publish

To publish a built policy image to the policy registry, use the `policy push` command:

```bash
policy push my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2
```

#### Pull

Using the `policy` CLI, you can pull a policy image from a Policy Repository just like you pull a docker image.

```bash
policy pull my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2
```

### Github Actions

Policy repositories generated by Aserto include Github Actions which automatically build and push new policy images to the Aserto Container Registry when a new tag is pushed to the repository.

```bash
git commit -am 'new policy version'
git tag v0.1.2 && git push --tags
```

**GitHub Actions Secret**

Aserto can set up a secret for you when you create a new policy.
You can also setup this secret yourself, using information from the **Policy Settings** tab in the Aserto Console.

The secret should be named `ASERTO_PUSH_KEY` and it should contain a JSON object that looks like this:

```json
{
  "tenant_id": "",
  "policy_id": "",
  "push_key": ""
}
```

### Run

To run a policy, you need to create a **policy instance** which is an instance of the decision engine's runtime associated with a tagged version of a policy. You can create multiple policy instances, each associated with a different version of a policy.

To create a policy instance, open the "Policies" tab in the Aserto console, and click "Create an instance":

Next, you'll be prompted to select a policy registry:

<img src="/select-policy-registry.png" width="500px" />

Select the policy registry you'd like to use from the dropdown.

Then, you'll be prompted to select a Policy organization. Choose the organization under which you created your repository.

Next, select the policy repository you want to associate with the policy instance.

<img src="/select-policy-repository.png" width="500px" />

Select the tag you'd like to associate with the policy instance.

Finally, name your policy instance and click "Create an instance".

### Consume

An application that wants to authorize a user's access to a resource based on the policy can call the policy instance, passing it the policy, decision(s), user context, and resource context, and the policy instance will evaluate the policy with the provided inputs and returns the boolean value(s) of the requested decision(s), allowing the application to definitively check whether the user has access to the resource based on the given policy.

The [`authz.is`](/docs/authorizer-guide/is) API is the underlying mechanism for an application to call the
policy instance to make a decision. The [language SDKs](/docs/software-development-kits/overview) provide higher-level abstractions for interacting with policy instances.
