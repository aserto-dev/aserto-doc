# Policy Lifecycle

## Policy

At the core of Asertoâ€™s authorization model is an authorization policy, which we refer to simply as a **Policy**. Policies are authored in a textual language called [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/), defined as part of the [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA) project in the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/).

Policies are treated just like application code or infrastructure-as-code - they can be stored as code in a git repository, or as an OCIv2 image in a policy repository (like the Aserto Policy Container Registry or the [Open Policy Registry](https://www.openpolicyregistry.io/)).

## The policy lifecycle

Policies are **authored** using a text / code editor, **built** into an image, **published** to a repository hosted on a registry, **run** in a policy instance, and **consumed** by an application.

Aserto's control plane helps manage the policy lifecycle.

### Author

Policies are comprised of a collection of `.rego` files and `.json` files, which provide static data that can be part of the policy.

### Build

The set of source files that comprise a policy are built into a **Policy Image** using a set of tools that are modeled after the `docker` toolset. You can build and tag a policy just like you build and tag a docker image.

There are two paths for building a policy image:

1. Using GitHub, a **build action** automatically builds a new version of a policy image when the source repository is **tagged** with a new tag.

```bash
git commit -am 'new policy version'
git tag v0.1.2 && git push --tags
```

2. Using the `policy` CLI to tag and push a policy image to a policy registry.

```bash
policy build . -t my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2
policy tag my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2 my-org/my-policy:latest
```

### Publish

Similar to building a policy, you can publish a policy image in one of two ways:

1. Pushing a new tag to a policy repository will trigger a Github action which will automatically publish the built policy image to the Aserto Policy Registry.

2. Using the `policy` CLI to push a policy image to a policy registry.

```bash
policy push my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2
```

### Pull

Using the `policy` CLI, you can pull a policy image from a Policy Repository just like you pull a docker image.

```bash
policy pull my-org/my-policy:v0.1.2
```

**GitHub Actions Secret**

Aserto can set up a secret for you when you create a new policy.
You can also setup this secret yourself, using information from the **Policy Settings** tab in the Aserto Console.
The secret is a JSON object that looks like this:

```json
{
  "tenant_id": "",
  "policy_id": "",
  "push_key": ""
}
```

### Run

To run a policy, you need to create a **policy instance** which is an instance of the decision engine's runtime associated with a tagged version of a policy. You can create multiple policy instances, each associated with a different version of a policy.

To create a policy instance, open the "Policies" tab in the Aserto console, and click "Create an instance":

Next, you'll be prompted to select a policy registry:

Select the policy registry you'd like to use from the dropdown.

Then, you'll be prompted to select a Policy organization. Choose the organization under which you created your repository.

Next, select the policy repository you want to associate with the policy instance.

<img src="/select-policy-repository.png" width="500px" />

Select the tag you'd like to associate with the policy instance.

Finally, name your policy instance and click "Create an instance".

### Consume

An application that wants to authorize a user's access to a resource based on the policy can call the policy instance, passing it the policy, decision(s), user context, and resource context, and the policy instance will evaluate the policy with the provided inputs and returns the boolean value(s) of the requested decision(s), allowing the application to definitively check whether the user has access to the resource based on the given policy.

The [`authz.is`](/docs/authorizer-guide/is) API is the underlying mechanism for an application to call the
policy instance to make a decision. The [language SDKs](/docs/software-development-kits/overview) provide higher-level abstractions for interacting with policy instances.
