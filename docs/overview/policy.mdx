# Authorization Policy

At the core of Asertoâ€™s authorization model is an authorization policy, which we refer to simply as a **Policy**. Policies are authored in a textual language called [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/), defined as part of the [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA) project in the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/).

## Policy Lifecycle

Policies are treated just like application code or infrastructure-as-code. They are **authored** using a text / code editor, stored in a git repository, **built** into an OCI binary image, **published** to a repository hosted on an OCI container registry, **run** in a Topaz instance, and **consumed** by an application.

Aserto's control plane helps manage the policy lifecycle. For more information on authoring policies and the policy lifecycle, see this [topic](policy-lifecycle).

## Policy Language Overview

A policy can include one or more `rego` files, and one or more JSON data files.

A `rego` file has a `package` directive which sets the namespace for the rego file, and defines one or more decisions.

```rego
package sample.GET.api.orders

allowed {
  true
}
```

:::note
In the rego file above, the `package` name follows the Aserto convention:

`policy-root`.`HTTP method`.`HTTP route`
:::

### Decision

A _decision_ is an output from the evaluation of a _policy_. The policy above exports a
decision called `allowed`, and sets its value to `true`.

The policy below exports the same decision (`allowed`), has a default value of `false` for this
decision, and a rule that sets `allowed` to true only if the logged-in users's `department` attribute
is equal to `"Sales"`:

```rego
package sample.GET.api.orders

default allowed = false

allowed {
  input.user.properties.department == "Sales"
}
```

### User context

In the policy above, we were able to use the `department` attribute to help compute the `allowed` decision. This is an example of User context that is used in a policy. If you hook up your identity providers and/or directories to the Aserto control plane, it will automatically synchronize properties from these sources and make them available to your policies.

User context is automatically resolved and injected into `input.user` when you pass in an [identity context](/docs/authorizer-guide/identity-context) to an authorizer [API call](/docs/authorizer-guide/authz).

Users, objects, and the relationships between them are all stored in the Aserto [Directory](/docs/overview/directory).

### Resource context

Policies can also use resource context in their evaluation process. If we added the `allowed` clause below to our policy, and the caller included a resource context that contains `{ "key": "<the-current-user-key>" }`, the policy would evaluate `allowed` to `true` if the user key and the resource key match.

```rego
allowed {
  input.user.key == input.resource.key
}
```

### Built-ins

To use data from the Aserto [Directory](/docs/overview/directory) in your policies, you can use one of the Aserto [built-ins](/docs/authorizer-guide/built-ins).
