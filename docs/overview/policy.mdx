# Authorization Policy

At the core of Asertoâ€™s authorization model is an authorization policy, which we refer to simply as a **Policy**. Policies are authored in a textual language called [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/), defined as part of the [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA) project in the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/).

A policy can include one or more `rego` files, and one or more JSON data files.

A `rego` file has a `package` directive which sets the namespace for the rego file, and defines one or more decisions.

```rego
package sample.GET.api.orders

allowed {
  true
}
```

:::note
In the rego file above, the `package` name follows the Aserto convention:

`policy-root`.`HTTP method`.`HTTP route`
:::

## Decision

A _decision_ is an output from the evaluation of a _policy_. The policy above exports a
decision called `allowed`, and sets its value to `true`.

The policy below exports the same decision (`allowed`), has a default value of `false` for this
decision, and a rule that sets `allowed` to true only if the logged-in users's `department` attribute
is equal to `"Sales"`:

```rego
package sample.GET.api.orders

default allowed = false

allowed {
  input.user.properties.department == "Sales"
}
```

## User context

In the policy above, we were able to use the `department` attribute to help compute the `allowed`
decision. This is an example of User context that is used in a policy. If you hook up your
identity providers and/or directories to Aserto, it will automatically synchronize properties from
these sources and make them available to your policies.

In addition, you can create and manage extensions for users in the Aserto directory, on a global or
per-application basis.

## Resource context

Policies can also use resource context in their evaluation process. If we added the allowed clause 
below to our policy, and the caller included a resource context that contains `{ "id": "<the-user-id>" }`, 
the policy would evaluate `allowed` to `true` if the user id and the resource id match.

```rego
allowed {
  input.user.id == input.resource.id
}

# Policy Lifecycle

Policies are treated just like application code or infrastructure-as-code - they can be stored as code in a git repository, or as an OCIv2 image in a policy repository (like the Aserto Policy Container Registry or the [Open Policy Registry](https://www.openpolicyregistry.io/)).

## Policy as code

Policies are **authored** using a text / code editor, **built** into an image, **published** to a repository hosted on a registry, **run** in a policy instance, and **consumed** by an application.

Aserto's control plane helps manage the policy lifecycle.
