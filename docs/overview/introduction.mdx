# Concepts

As shown in the Aserto Architecture [diagram](../architecture), Aserto's platform consists of a number of runtime components which are either hosted by Aserto or can be run in your own environment:

## Overview of Concepts

Authorization:
* [Authorizer](authorizer): the component that makes authorization decisions on whether or not a user is allowed to perform an operation on a resource. Aserto uses [Topaz](https://topaz.sh) as its authorizer.
* [Policy](policy): defines the rules for making authorization decisions.
* [Directory](directory): stores a graph of subjects (such as users and groups), objects (including any properties used for authorization purposes), and the relationships between them, all of which can be used by the policy.
* [Decision Logs](decision-logs): records of decisions performed by Authorizers.

Management:
* [Tenant](tenant): the unit of isolation and management of Policy Instances, Policy Images, Directory data, Decision Logs, Connections, and Edge Authorizers.
* [Control Plane](control-plane): manages Edge Authorizers: keeps policy and data up-to-date, aggregates Decision Logs, and sends remote commands to Edge Authorizers.
* [Connections](connections): connections to external systems such as Identity Providers (which are often the source of Directory data) and Source Code Control Systems (which are where policies are stored and versioned).
* [Organization](organization): a type of tenant that is shared across multiple collaborators, and enforces an RBAC model.
