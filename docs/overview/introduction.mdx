# Introduction

Aserto is a cloud-native authorization platform that allows developers to get out of the business of rolling out custom access control solutions, and instead focus on their core user experience.  

## Architecture
As shown in the Aserto Architecture [diagram](../architecture), Aserto's platform consists of a number of runtime components which are either hosted by Aserto or running in your own environment.

## Concepts
* [Authorizer](authorizer) - Makes authorization decisions on whether or not a caller can access a secure resource
* [Policy](policy) - Defines rules for making authorization decisions
* [Directory](directory) -  Stores a graph of objects (like Users and Groups) and related information which are used by the policy.  
* [Decision Logs](decision-logs) - Records of decisions performed by Authorizers
* [Control Plane](control-plane) - Manages the lifecycle of policies, user context, and data used by the Authorizer
* [Connections](connections) - Connections to external systems that are the source of Aserto artifacts
* [Organization](organization) - A container of artifacts managed by Aserto including Connections, Policies, and the Directory
