# Concepts

As shown in the Aserto Architecture [diagram](../architecture), Aserto's platform consists of a number of runtime components which are either hosted by Aserto or can be run in your own environment:

## Overview of Concepts

* [Authorizer](authorizer): the component that makes authorization decisions on whether or not a user is allowed to perform an operation on a resource.
* [Policy](policy): defines the rules for making authorization decisions.
* [Directory](directory): stores a graph of subjects (such as users and groups), objects (including any properties used for authorization purposes), and the relationships between them, all of which can be used by the policy.
* [Decision Logs](decision-logs): records of decisions performed by Authorizers.
* [Control Plane](control-plane): manages the lifecycle of the policies, user context, and resource data used by the Authorizer.
* [Connections](connections): connections to external systems such as Identity Providers (which are often the source of Directory data) and Source Code Control Systems (which are where policies are stored and versioned).
* [Organization](organization): also known as an Aserto Tenant - a container of per-tenant artifacts managed by Aserto including Connections, Policies, Directory data, and Decision Logs.
