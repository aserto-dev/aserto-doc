# Directory

The Aserto Directory stores information required to make authorization decisions. It is flexible enough to easily
support different access control strategies including Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control
(ABAC), and Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC).

An authorization decision is an answer to the question *"Is subject __S__ allowed to perform action __A__ on resource __R__?"*
In other words, authorization decisions determine whether a subject (user, group, service, etc.) has a given permission on a resource
(document, folder, project, etc.).


## Concepts

The Aserto Directory helps to define policies that make authorization decisions through three main concepts:
* __Object__: Objects represent the participants in authorization decisions. Some objects represent __subjects__&mdash;actors who _perform_
  actions&mdash;and other may represent __resources__&mdash;the items that subjects can attempt to access in various ways.

* __Permission__: A kind of action that subjects may attempt to perform.

* __Relation__: A _labeled_ association between a source object and a target object, which may carry with it a set of
  _permissions_.

Using these concepts, an authorization decision can be rephrased as *"Does subject __S__ have a relation that carries
permission __P__ with resource __R__?"* A relation between a subject and a resource can be defined explicitly, or be implied from
group membership. For example, the subject __S__ may be a _member_ of group __G__, which in turn has a relation that
carries permission __P__ with the resource __R__.

### Directory as a Graph

It is convenient to think of the Aserto Directory as a graph in which objects are the nodes and relations the edges.
Under this model, the authorization quesion in the previous section can be rephrased again as *"Is there a path from
the node __S__ to the node __R__ in which one or more edges have permission __P__?"*

Indeed, the directory API provides methods to query and traverse this graph of objects and relations.

### Examples

With these building blocks, it's possible to construct expressions like:
* *Euan* is a *member* of the *Sales-group*
* *Sales-folder* is a *parent* of the *Sales-plan-document*
* *Sales-group* is a *viewer* of the *Sales-folder*
* The *viewer* relation includes the *read* permission

And answer queries like:
* Does *Euan* have the *read* permission on the *Sales-plan-document* ?

The Aserto directory is able to evaluate this graph query, traversing through these relationship and determining the outcome.

## Types

To help define different kinds of objects and specify the relations that may exist between them, the Aserto Directory
provides two extensible sets of types:
* __Object Types__ define the kinds of objects that can be created in the directory.
* __Relation Types__ define the kinds of relations that can be created between directory objects.


### Built-in Object Types

The Directory is pre-configured with a few types:
* **User**: a principal (used as a subject)
* **Group**: used to model a collection of users and/or other groups (can be used as a subject or object)
* **Identity**: an identifier for a User (e.g. email, PID)
* **Application**: an object that a User may have a relationship to
* **Resource**: a generic resource

### Built-in Relation Types

The following relation types are also pre-configured:


| Relation type | Object type | Description                         |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| Member        | Group       | A subject is a member of a group    |
| Identifier    | Identity    | A user is identified by an identity |
| User          | Application | A user can have applications        |
| Manager       | User        | A user has a manager                |


The Aserto Directory seeds User instances and Identity instances (and the relationships between them) from
any identity providers that has been [connected](/docs/overview/connections) to the control plane.  Some identity
providers also allow importing Group objects. All of these imported objects are available to Authorizer instances
for making authorization decisions.

### User-defined types

Object and relation types are extensible. Aserto makes it easy to create your own types
which model your resource hierarchy / domain model. For example, you may have Organizations, which may have Folders.
Aserto lets you create these object types in the directory, along with relation types (like Viewer, Editor, Admin, Owner)
which model the relationship between these objects and subject types (such as User or Group).

## Directory implementations

An an abstract level, a Directory is a service that implements the Directory [gRPC contract](https://buf.build/aserto-dev/directory).

Currently there are three implementations.

### Aserto Central Directory

The Aserto central directory, hosted at `directory.prod.aserto.com`, is a Postgres-backed multi-tenant implementation of the directory contract. Every Aserto tenant / organization is provisioned with a single directory tenant. The directory contents are accessible to a caller via read-only and read-write API keys, and are shared across Policies.

### Topaz Directory (EDS)

Each Topaz instance has its own clone of the directory, known as the Edge Directory Service (EDS), implemented as an embedded BoltDB database. Topaz authorizers use the EDS for real-time access to anything stored in the directory, including user properties, groups, roles/relationships, and any other objects. These can be accessed in policies to help make authorization decisions.

Aserto transparently synchronizes changes from the source identity providers (e.g. Auth0) to the Aserto Central Directory, and from the Directory to each of the Edge Directory Services that live within the Topaz Authorizers.

### Local Directory

The Postgres-backed Aserto Directory can be deployed as a container in a customer environment. This deployment option is available with a commercial license.

## Authorizers and the Directory

The Aserto Hosted Authorizer is configured to connect to the Aserto Central Directory. 

Topaz can be configured to connect to any of the three Directory implementations mentioned above. By default, Topaz spins up its own EDS, but can be configured to connect to a remote Directory implementation - the Local Directory or the Central Directory.

Regardless of the Directory implementation, Policies can access Directory contents via a set of [built-ins](/docs/authorizer-guide/built-ins).
