# Overview

Topaz authorizers are built to be deployed right next to your application, in your cloud.

## Aserto Sidecar

The simplest local deployment is in the form of a single container or Sidecar. You can deploy it either as a local microservice (and scale it horizontally), or if you're running in Kubernetes, you can deploy it as a sidecar in your application pod.

The Sidecar container implements the Aserto Directory using an embedded database, based on BoltDB. It scales up to a couple of GB of data (which could house 10k's of users, depending on how many properties each user contains).

The [Edge Authorizers](/docs/edge-authorizers/overview.mdx) documentation describes the Sidecar and its deployment and management in more detail.

## Local Directory

The second flavor of a local deployment is to host the Aserto Directory as a separate container. This implementation of the Aserto Directory uses Postgres as a back-end relational store, and can scale to larger data sizes than can fit in the embedded store.

The [Local Directory](local-directory/overview.mdx) documentation describes the scenarios where running a separate directory is advantageous, and how to deploy it in your local Kubernetes environment.
