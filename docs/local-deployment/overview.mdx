# Overview

Aserto authorizers are built to be deployed right next to your application, in your cloud.

## Edge Authorizer

The simplest local deployment is in the form of a single Topaz container that is configured as an Aserto Edge Authorizer. You can deploy it either as a local microservice (and scale it horizontally), or if you're running in Kubernetes, you can deploy it as a sidecar in your application pod.

The Edge Authorizer includes an Aserto Directory that is implemented using an embedded database, based on BoltDB. It scales up to a couple of GB of data (which could house 10k's of users, depending on how many properties each user contains).

The [Edge Authorizers](/docs/edge-authorizers/overview.mdx) documentation describes the Edge Authorizer and its deployment and management in more detail.

## Local Directory

The second flavor of a local authorizer deployment adds a separate separate Aserto Directory running in its own container, as well as a Console for adminstering. This implementation of the Aserto Directory uses Postgres as a back-end relational store, and can scale to larger data sizes than can fit in the embedded store. 

The [Local Directory](local-directory/overview.mdx) documentation describes the scenarios where running A self-hosted directory is advantageous, and how to deploy it in your local Kubernetes environment.
