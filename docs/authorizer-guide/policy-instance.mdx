# Policy Instance

The `is`, `decisiontree`, `query`  and `compile` APIs for the Aserto Hosted Authorizer take a Policy Instance argument from the calling application.

This parameter identifies the policy instance created in the Aserto Console. The `"name"` field is the policy instance name, and the `"instanceLabel"` field identifies the specific instance.

:::note
Currently, the Aserto Console only allows creating a single authorizer instance for each policy instance, with the `instanceLabel` set to `name`. Creating more than once instance label per policy instance is on the feature roadmap.
:::

## Setting the Policy Instance

`POST .../api/v2/is`

```json
{
  "policyInstance": {
    "name": "[policy-name]",
    "instanceLabel": "[instance-label]"
  }, ...
}
```
