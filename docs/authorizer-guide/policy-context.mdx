# Policy Context

The `is`, `decisiontree`, and `query` APIs take a Policy Context argument from the calling application.

This parameter identifies the policy path and decision(s) to evaluate. The rule within the bundle is identified by the `path`, and the `decisions` array denotes one or more decisions to be made by the authorizer.

## Setting the Policy Context

`POST .../api/authz/v2/is`

```json
{
  "policyContext": {
    "decisions": [
      "allowed"
    ],
    "path": "sample.GET.api.orders"
  }, ...
}
```

The policy context above will evaluate the `allowed` decision for the policy module
`sample.GET.api.orders`.

For the following Rego package:

```rego
package sample.GET.api.orders

allowed {
  true
}
```

Calling `is` with the above payload will return the following response:

```json
{
  "decisions": [
    {
      "decision": "allowed",
      "is": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Policy context for `decisiontree`

The common usage for `policyContext` in the `decisiontree` API is to identify the  the policy root and the decisions to evaluate.

`POST .../api/v2/authz/decisiontree`

```json
{
  "policyContext": {
    "decisions": [
      "visible",
      "enabled"
    ],
    "path": "sample"
  }, ...
}
```

This call will evaluate all paths under the "sample" root, and return the values of the "visible" and "enabled" decisions
using the `identityContext` and `resourceContext` that may also be passed in.

## Policy context in `input`

The `policyContext` passed in will be available to the policy as `input.policy`. You can write a generic policy
that can reason about which specific policy it is being evaluated over.

## Upgrading from v1

To upgrade from the v1 Policy Context, see this [topic](/docs/authorizer-guide/upgrading-from-v1.mdx).

# Deprecated v1 Policy Context

:::danger Note
These APIs are no longer supported. The are documented here for users who still need to update to the v2 APIs, and want to understand the differences.
:::

The v1 `authz.is`, `authz.decisiontree`, and `authz.query` APIs take a v1 Policy Context argument from the calling application.

This parameter identifies the policy and decision(s) to evaluate.

The policy bundle is identified by the policy `id`, the policy within the bundle by the `path` and the `decisions` array denotes one ore more decisions to be made by the authorizer.

## Setting the Policy Context

`POST .../api/v1/authz/is`

```json
{
  "policyContext": {
    "decisions": [
      "allowed"
    ],
    "id": "[policy-id]",
    "path": "sample.GET.api.orders"
  }, ...
}
```

The policy context above will evaluate the `allowed` decision for the policy module
`sample.GET.api.orders`.

For the following Rego package:

```rego
package sample.GET.api.orders

allowed {
  true
}
```

Calling `is` with the above payload will return the following response:

```json
{
  "decisions": [
    {
      "decision": "allowed",
      "is": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Policy context for `decisiontree`

The common usage for `policyContext` in the `decisiontree` API is to identify the policy ID and the policy root.

`POST .../api/v1/authz/decisiontree`

```json
{
  "policyContext": {
    "decisions": [
      "visible",
      "enabled"
    ],
    "id": "[policy-id]",
    "path": "sample"
  }, ...
}
```

This call will evaluate all paths under the "sample" root, and return the values of the "visible" and "enabled" decisions
using the `identityContext` and `resourceContext` that may also be passed in.

## Policy context for `query`

The Policy ID can be used to evaluate the query in the context of a particular policy.

## Policy context in `input`

The `policyContext` passed in will be available to the policy as `input.policy`. You can write a generic policy
that can reason about which specific policy it is being evaluated over.
