# Overview

The Authorizer is an open source authorization engine which uses the
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) (OPA) to
compute a [**decision**](/docs/overview/policy#decision) based on a [**policy**](/docs/overview/policy),
[**user context**](/docs/overview/policy#user-context), and **data**.

An application can interact with the Authorizer through a set of gRPC or HTTPS REST APIs.

## REST API documentation

The Aserto Authorizer APIs are documented [here](https://aserto.readme.io/reference/authorizercompile). They are generated from
the OpenAPI specification of each of the APIs, and and are meant to be used as the definitive reference
for the Authorizer API surface.

:::tip
If you have an Aserto account, sign in to the [console](https://console.aserto.com), and
select the `API Docs` menu item. This will bring up an authenticated experience for the
reference docs, and automatically fill in the current Tenant ID, authorizer API key, and JWT
so that you can directly execute API calls from the dashboard.

## Hosted Authorizer vs Edge Authorizer

Creating an Aserto tenant automatically creates a corresponding Authorizer instance in the multi-tenant hosted Authorizer. Since it's a multi-tenant service, the hosted Authorizer requires authorization headers to disambiguate the tenant and provide the tenant secret (API key).

The Aserto authorizer can also be [deployed as a sidecar (or as a local service)](/docs/edge-authorizers/overview), right next to your application. Since this Authorizer is a single-tenant service, it does not require authentication, besides the certificate validation mandated by HTTPS mutual TLS.

## Authorization

Any API call to the hosted Authorizer requires two HTTP headers:

- `Aserto-Tenant-ID: <Tenant-ID>`
- `Authorization: basic <Authorizer-API-Key>`

You can find these values in the [Policy settings](/docs/aserto-console/view-policies#viewing-policy-settings)
in the Aserto Console.

## Authorizer API categories

The Authorizer provides the following API categories to calling applications:

- [Authorization](/docs/authorizer-guide/authz) (`authz`)
- [Policy](/docs/authorizer-guide/policy) (`policy`)
- Information (`info`)

:::note
The v1 [Directory](/docs/authorizer-guide/dir) (`dir`) namespace is now deprecated in favor of the v2 Directory [graphQL APIs](/docs/directory-guide/scenario.mdx).

The v1 System (`sys`) namespace is now removed from v2.
