# Built-in Functions

Aserto provides a set of built-in functions that can be used in your policy. These functions make it easier to leverage information found the Aserto directory.

:::note
When providing a user's identity, you can use a GUID, PID or an email associated with the user.
:::

## v1 built-ins

### `dir.identity`
```js
dir.identity(user)
```
Returns the user's Aserto directory `id` by a key.

For example: `dir.identity("euang@acmecorp.com")` will return `dfdadc39-7335-404d-af66-c77cf13a15f8`.

### `dir.is_same_user`
```js
dir.is_same_user(userA, userB)
```
Returns `true` if the identities of userA and userB are the same identity.

For example: `dir.is_same_user("euang@acmecorp.com", "dfdadc39-7335-404d-af66-c77cf13a15f8")` will return `true`.

### `dir.user`
```js
dir.user(user)
```
Returns the user object by the user identity.

For example: `dir.user("dfdadc39-7335-404d-af66-c77cf13a15f8")` will return the user object of for the user `euang@acmecorp.com`.

### `dir.manager_of`
```js
dir.manager_of(user)
```
Returns the user object of the manager of a user, based on the `manager` attribute of the user specified.

For example: `dir.manager_of("euang@acmecorp.com")` will return the user object of `aprils@acmecorp.com`.

### `dir.is_manager_of`
```js
dir.is_manager_of(userA, userB)
```
Returns `true` if userA is a manager of userB, based on the `manager` attribute of userB and the identity of userA.

For example: `dir.is_manager_of("aprils@acmecorp.com", "euang@acmecorp.com")` will return `true`.

### `dir.management_chain`
```js
dir.management_chain
```
Returns the management chain of a user as a list of user ids.

For example: `dir.management_chain("euang@acmecorp.com")` will return:

```json
{
  "chain": [
    "dfdadc39-7335-404d-af66-c77cf13a15f8",
    "2bfaa552-d9a5-41e9-a6c3-5be62b4433c8",
    "37b056d8-f63e-412b-b172-63d60d35ea56",
    "2a43d793-7367-4a3e-8c6e-5ec955a52038",
    "242f6e15-e469-4e42-9510-0483f6d019c9",
    "7846c22f-d3d8-4e02-8b62-d055d0284783",
    "b7de08a6-8417-491b-be62-85945a538f46"
  ]
}
```

## v2 built-ins

V2 built-ins provide access to data stored in Aserto's ReBAC directory. 

:::note
The parameter passing convention has changed from positional arguments to a JSON map that contains named arguments.
:::

### `ds.identity`
```js
ds.identity({
  "key": "<value>"
})
```
Looks up a user identity by one of the keys (e.g. email address or PID), and returns the `id` of the user object.

For example: `ds.identity({ "key": "euang@acmecorp.com" })` will return `dfdadc39-7335-404d-af66-c77cf13a15f8`.

### `ds.object`
```js
ds.object({
  "id": "<id>"
})
```
Returns an object instance looked up by its unique `<id>`.

```js
ds.object({
  "type": "<type>",
  "key": "<value>"
})
```
Returns an object instance of `<type>`, looked up by the key supplied as `<value>`.

For example: `ds.object({ "type": "identity", "key": "euang@acmecorp.com" })` will return the identity object associated with Euan.

### `ds.relation`

```js
ds.relation({
  "object_id": "<object-id>",
  "object_type": "<object-type>",
  "relation": "<relation-name>",
  "subject_id": "<subject-id>",
  "subject_type": "<subject-type>"
})
```
Returns the relation instance that connects the subject with the object through the relation identified by `<object-type>` and `<relation-name>`.

### `ds.check_relation`

```js
ds.check_relation({
  "object": {
    "id": "<object-id>",
    "key": "<object-key>",
    "type": "<object-type>"
  },
  "relation": {
    "name": "<relation-name>",
    "object_type": "<object-type>"
  },
  "subject": {
    "id": "<subject-id>",
    "key": "<subject-key>",
    "type": "<subject-type>"
  }
})
```
An object can be identified either by its `<object-id>` or by the combination of its `<object-type>` and `<object-key>`. The same is true for a subject.

A relation type is uniquely identified by the object type name and the relation name. A relation instance of that type will relate an object instance to a subject instance.

`ds.check_relation` returns `true` if the object instance has a relation of the type specified to the subject instance. 

### `ds.check_permission`

```js
ds.check_permission({
  "object": {
    "id": "<object-id>",
    "key": "<object-key>",
    "type": "<object-type>"
  },
  "permission": {
    "name": "<permission-name>",
  },
  "subject": {
    "id": "<subject-id>",
    "key": "<subject-key>",
    "type": "<subject-type>"
  }
})
```
An object can be identified either by its `<object-id>` or by the combination of its `<object-type>` and `<object-key>`. The same is true for a subject.

`ds.check_permission` returns`true` if the subject has the permission `permission-name` referenced through one or more relations to the object.

### `ds.graph`

```js
ds.graph({
	"id": "<object-id>",
	"object_type": "",
	"object_id": "",
	"subject_type": "",
	"subject_id": "",
	"relation": ""
})
```
Returns the graph of relations and objects that is anchored in `object-id`. All other arguments are optional and restrict the graph returned to specific subjects, objects, or relations. The graph will be traversed up until a maximum depth, to avoid infinite recursion through graph cycles.
