# Overview

Decision logs are records of the decisions performed by Aserto authorizers that are collected into a central location by the Aserto Control Plane. Both hosted and edge authorizers can generate decision logs for policies that have them enabled.

## Turning on Decision Logging

Decision logs can be configured for each policy and viewed on the Aserto [console](/docs/decision-logs-guide/console).

## Decision log storage

Decision logs are stored as objects, each holding about an hour's worth of decisions for a given policy. The
[Aserto API](/docs/decision-logs-guide/api/overview) incudes support for discovering and downloading storage objects and for accessing a timely view of the most recent decisions.

Integrating Aserto decision log data into data warehousing and analysis tools can be automated using the
[Aserto CLI](/docs/command-line-interface/aserto-cli/decision-logs) as well as through the [APIs](/docs/decision-logs-guide/api/overview.mdx).
