# decision_logs/users

The `users` API provides a convenient way to retrieve user information that is referenced by decision log storage
objects. See [schema](/docs/decision-logs-guide/schemas) for details of what information decision log objects contain.

## URL

`GET .../api/v1/decision_logs/users`

This form returns a list of names of available user storage objects, each of which can be provided to the
second form of this API to retrieve a secure download location (URL):

`GET .../api/v1/decision_logs/users/{name}`

Where `name` was previously retrieved using the list call. Note that storage object names must be
URL-encoded before using them to retrieve a download location.

## Example

The list call to retrieve user object names is:

`GET .../api/v1/decision_logs/users`

The response would be similar to:

```json
{
  "page": {
    "next_token": "",
    "result_size": 3,
    "total_size": 0
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "011a88bc-7df9-4d92-ba1f-2ff319e101e1",
      "updated_at": "2022-02-02T18:16:33Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "01d1e01e-bf53-419a-9762-17270b1a7328",
      "updated_at": "2022-02-02T18:16:33Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "026dc3e3-4406-43c7-9a3e-cba432b0447b",
      "updated_at": "2022-02-02T18:16:33Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note the `updated_at` field, which can be used to avoid retrieving user objects that haven't changed since last
retrieved.

Passing one of the resulting names to the retrieval call:

`GET .../api/v1/decision_logs/users/011a88bc-7df9-4d92-ba1f-2ff319e101e1`

Yields a response similar to:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/..."
  }
}
```

`url` can be used to download the object, which is a JSON file, using standard HTTP tools. The URL is signed
and valid for 15 minutes.
