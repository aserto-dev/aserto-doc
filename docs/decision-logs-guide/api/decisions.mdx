# decision_logs/decisions

The `decisions` API opens a [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) that receives
decision events in near real time; events are typically no more than a minute old. 

## WebSocket

### Create a new decision logs WebSocket
```javascript
ws = new WebSocket("wss://decision-logs.prod.aserto.com/api/v1/decision_logs/decisions/policy/<policy-id>",
  [
      "Basic", "<Decision-Logs-API-Key>",
      "TenantID", "<Tenant-ID>"
  ])
```

The new WebSocket will receive decision logs for the specified policy. The second parameter is analogous to 
adding headers to an HTTP call that authenticates using the decision logs
[API key](/docs/decision-logs-guide/console#decision-logs-api-key).
Specifying an empty `policy-id` causes events for all policies in the tenant to appear in the stream.

### Receiving decision log events

The `onmessage` handler is called for every decision that occurs using the policy specified when the WebSocket was created.
```javascript
ws.onmessage = function(e) {
  processDecision(e)
}   
```

### Buffered events

The Aserto control plane buffers decision events for usage by the WebSocket stream, at most 1000 of them. The `since` 
argument can be provided to control the oldest event that delivery should start from.

```javascript
ws = new WebSocket("wss://decision-logs.prod.aserto.com/api/v1/decision_logs/decisions/policy/<policy-id>?since=<start date-time>",
  ...)
```

The value of `since` should be in [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) format. For example: 
`2022-03-21T06:30:00Z`.
