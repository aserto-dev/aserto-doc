# Creating an Attribute Based Access Control Policy

We're going to create an ABAC policy that will interact with our PeopleFinder application. First, open the Aserto Console and navigate to the **Policies** tab. Click on the "Add a Policy" button:

![add-a-policy](/getting-started-acmecorp/add-a-policy.png)

Create a new policy based on the `policy-peoplefinder` template, and name it `peoplefinder-abac`.

![policy-from-template](/getting-started-acmecorp/policy-from-template.png)

Open the policy once it is created, and open the `peoplefinder.POST.api.users.__id` module.

![console-policy-peoplefinder-post](/getting-started-acmecorp/console-policy-peoplefinder-post.png)

As you can see, this policy is slightly different from the RBAC policy we created before: instead of referencing the `data` object (which is based on the definitions in the `data.json` file) and the roles defined there, it uses the user's _attributes_ to determine whether they are equal to a specific value.

In this module, we check whether the user's `department` attribute is equal to `Operations`. If the check yields a `true` value, the user will be `allowed` to perform the `POST` operation on the `/api/users/:id` resource - which means they'll be able to update the `title` and `department` attributes of another user.

This policy will result in a dynamic behavior of the authorization model: any user assigned to the `Operations` department _at runtime_ will now have the permission to make updates to other users as well.

Let's update our PeopleFinder application to point to this new policy to see it in action.
