# Creating an Attribute Based Access Control Policy

We're going to create an ABAC policy that will interact with our PeopleFinder application.

## Create the policy repository

First, open the Aserto Console and navigate to the Policies tab. Click on the "Create a new repository" button:

Select "Use a template":

Choose your source code provider:

Create a new policy based on the `policy-peoplefinder-abac` template, and name the repo `policy-peoplefinder-abac`.

Finally, name your policy repository `peoplefinder-abac`, and click "Create a new policy repository":

## Create a policy instance

Navigate to the Policies tab and click "Create a new policy instance":

You'll be prompted to select a policy registry:

![select-policy-registry](/select-policy-registry.png)

Select "Aserto Policy Registry" from the dropdown.

Next, from the "Select organization" dropdown select your personal (account) organization.

From the "Policy repository" dropdown, select "peoplefinder-abac".

  width="500px"
/>

From the "Tag list" dropdown, select "latest".

<img src="/select-tag.png" width="500px" />

Finally, name your instance `peoplefinder-abac` and click "Create an instance".

<img
  src="/getting-started-acmecorp/name-policy-instance-abac.png"
  width="500px"
/>

Open the policy instance once it is created, and open the `peoplefinder.POST.api.users.__id` module.

As you can see, this policy is slightly different from the RBAC policy we created before: instead of referencing the `data` object (which is based on the definitions in the `data.json` file) and the roles defined there, it uses the user's _attributes_ to determine whether they are equal to a specific value.

In this module, we check whether the user's `department` attribute is equal to `Operations`. If the check yields a `true` value, the user will be `allowed` to perform the `POST` operation on the `/api/users/:id` resource - which means they'll be able to update the `title` and `department` attributes of another user.

This policy will result in a dynamic behavior of the authorization model: any user assigned to the `Operations` department _at runtime_ will now have the permission to make updates to other users as well.

Let's update our PeopleFinder application to point to this new policy to see it in action.
