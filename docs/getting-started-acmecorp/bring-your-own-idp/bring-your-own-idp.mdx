# Bring Your Own Identity Provider (Auth0)

## Overview

Aserto can connect to one or more identity providers as the source of user attributes and roles. So far, we were using the Acmecorp demo identity provider. Next, we’re going to review how to connect Auth0 as an identity provider. Then, we’ll seed your IDP with a set of users different from the ones which exist in the Acmecorp demo IDP.

## Remove the Acmecorp Users

In order to remove the Acmecorp users from your directory, head to the Connections tab and remove the Acmecorp connection.

## Next steps

Next, we'll configure your Auth0 tenant.
