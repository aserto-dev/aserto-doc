# Deployment and Operation

Edge authorizers can be deployed in various ways based on the application and target environment needs and requirements.
In its most basic form, an authorizer is a Docker container instance, which can be deployed as a standalone service,
sidecar, or development workstation.

An edge authorizer always operates in the context of a (single) Aserto organization and is assigned a specific policy
instance to serve. This information is provided to the edge authorizer via a configuration file, which it uses to send a
discovery call to the Aserto control plane.

## Edge Authorizer Flavors

:::danger Note
The `sidecar` authorizer is replaced by the [topaz](https://github.com/aserto-dev/topaz).
:::


Currently the following flavors of edge authorizers are available:

- Topaz: a single-tenant, single policy authorizer without a web UI. Topaz is the general edge authorizer flavor with a small surface area, which can be used as a sidecar but also as a local service instance.

## Docker images

| Flavor  | Image
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------
| Topaz   | docker pull ghcr.io/aserto-dev/topaz:latest

:::danger Note
Only Topaz images with a version of 0.25.6 or higher support being deployed as an edge authorizer.

## Running the Edge Authorizer

You can run the sidecar authorizer using `aserto` CLI. First, you need to configure your sidecar instance by running the following command. Note that POLICY_INSTANCE_NAME below is the name of a policy instance you created in the console. You can optionally turn on decision logging by using the corresponding flag:

```sh
aserto developer configure <POLICY_INSTANCE_NAME> [--decision-logging]
```

To configure the sidecar to connect to the Aserto control plane, use the following command. Note that EDGE_AUTHORIZER_CONNECTION_ID is the connection ID of an edge authorizer that you [created in the Aserto console](/docs/aserto-console/connections/setup-edge.mdx). 

```sh
aserto developer configure <POLICY_INSTANCE_NAME> --edge-authorizer=<EDGE_AUTHORIZER_CONNECTION_ID> [--decision-logging]
```

:::note Tip
To list the available edge authorizer connections, use the following command:
```sh
aserto control-plane list-connections
```
:::

Then, start the sidcar instance by running the following command. Note that if you turned on decision logging in the configure command, you need to specify the `--data-path` flag, where the DECISION_LOG_DIRECTORY is a path to where the decision logs will be stored.

```sh
aserto developer start <POLICY_INSTANCE_NAME> [--data-path=<DECISION_LOG_DIRECTORY>]
```

Or by using the `docker` CLI selecting the correct image (`ghcr.io/aserto-dev/topaz:latest`):

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

docker run \
-ti \
--rm \
--name edge \
--platform=linux/amd64 \
-p 8282:8282 \
-p 8383:8383 \
-p 8484:8484 \
-v $PWD/certs:/certs:rw \
-v $PWD/cfg:/cfg:ro \
-v $PWD/eds:/db:rw \
ghcr.io/aserto-dev/topaz:latest run \
--config-file /cfg/config.yaml
```
