# Security and Management

The Aserto control plane can be used to control certain operations on running edge authorizers. For example, one can
list running edge authorizers and issue policy and directory sync commands. This link between the Aserto control plane
and edge authorizers requires setting up a secure connection between the two.

## Edge Authorizer Connections

Edge authorizer connections can be created from the [Aserto console](/docs/aserto-console/connections/setup-edge) or API and provide an identity that edge authorizers
can use to connect to the control plane. Edge authorizers can use this identity by presenting a client certificate;
performing a [mutual TLS handshake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication). This identity is only
authorized to establish a connection to the Aserto control plane for the purpose of receiving control commands.

Edge authorizers use one of these identities by presenting the client certificate associated with a given edge authorizer
connection. All edge authorizers presenting the same client certificate use the same identity and there can be as many
edge authorizer connections as needed.

Once an edge authorizer is connected to the Aserto control plane:
- It will automatically refresh its policy state when a new policy image is pushed.
- It will automatically refresh its policy state when the policy instance changes.
- It can receive remote commands to refresh its policy and directory state.
- Its ability to connect can be revoked by deleting the edge authorizer connection from which its client certificates
  were obtained.

## Configuration

### Onebox

The Aserto CLI can be used to configure a onebox to use the control plane by adding an option to the `configure`
sub-command:
```
aserto x configure <policy-name> --edge-authorizer <edge-authorizer-connection-id>
```

This will install the client certificates and configure the onebox to connect to the control plane using them. The
`edge-authorizer-connection-id` can be acquired from the console, or using the Aserto CLI:

```
aserto p list-connections
```

The `list-connections` sub-command lists all the edge authorizer connections the tenant has.

### Sidecar

To configure a sidecar authorizer, it is first necessary to get the client certificates for the desired edge authorizer
connection. This can be done with the Aserto CLI:

```
aserto p client-cert <edge-authorizer-connection-id>
```

This will return a JSON object with data about the client certificate, for example:

```json
{                                                                                                                                            
  "certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- <elided data> -----END CERTIFICATE-----",                                                                                                                                   
  "common_name": "edge-test.69b537c3-8db5-11ec-8417-00c5cc9cb8c0.edge-authorizer.aserto.com",                                                        
  "expiration": "2022-06-24T17:11:31Z",                                                                                                      
  "id": "2b:d0:75:a0:7f:25:e8:2d:75:3d:20:cd:f3:e7:0c:f6:8d:02:94:01",                                                                       
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- <elided data> -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"                                                                                                              
}                                                                                                                                            
```

The `certificate` field contains the certificate in PEM format and the `private_key` field contains the private key,
also in PEM format. The contents of these fields should be saved as two files, for example
`~/.config/aserto/sidecar.crt` and `~/.config/aserto/sidecar.key`.

Using the paths in the example, the configuration file of a sidecar can be updated to connect to the control plane by
adding a section similar to:

```yaml
controller:
  enabled: true
  server:
    address: relay.prod.aserto.com:8443
      client_cert_path: ~/.config/aserto/sidecar.crt
      client_key_path: ~/.config/aserto/sidecar.key
      tenant_id: <TENANT-ID>
      policy_id: <POLICY-ID>
```
