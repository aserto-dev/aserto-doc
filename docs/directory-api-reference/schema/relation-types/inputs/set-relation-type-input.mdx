  hash: Hash
}
```


### Fields

#### [`id`](#) ([`TypeID`](/docs/directory-api-reference/schema/common/scalars/type-id))

ID of an existing relation type to update. If set, a relation type with the specified ID must already exist.


#### [`name`](#) ([`String`](/docs/directory-api-reference/schema/common/scalars/string))

Name of the relation type.


#### [`objectType`](#) ([`ObjectTypeSelector`](/docs/directory-api-reference/schema/object-types/inputs/object-type-selector))

The type of object that can be the source of the relation. If `id` is set the `objectType` is optional and if
specified, must match the object type defined on the existing relation type.


#### [`displayName`](#) ([`String`](/docs/directory-api-reference/schema/common/scalars/string))

Display name of the relation type.


#### [`ordinal`](#) ([`Int`](/docs/directory-api-reference/schema/common/scalars/int))

Sort ordinal of the relation type.


#### [`status`](#) ([`[Flag!]`](/docs/directory-api-reference/schema/common/enums/flag))

A set of flags that describe the status of the relation type.


#### [`unions`](#) ([`[RelationTypeSelector!]`](/docs/directory-api-reference/schema/relation-types/inputs/relation-type-selector))

A list of relation types that are supertypes of this relation type.

This relation type receives all permissions defined in the supertypes.
Unioned relation types must be defined with the same object type.


#### [`hash`](#) ([`Hash`](/docs/directory-api-reference/schema/common/scalars/hash))

Optional value of the hash value previously read from the directory.

If a hash value is specified and the relation type being mutated already exists, the update will be rejected unless the hash
value matches the existing relation type's hash value.
This can be used to ensure that the relation type being mutated has not been modified since it was read from the directory.
