# Overview

The Aserto [Directory](/docs/overview/directory) stores objects (users, groups, and custom objects) as well as relationships between them, which can be used to evaluate fine-grained authorization decisions.

Each of the Aserto [SDKs](/docs/software-development-kits/overview) contains a set of language bindings for the Directory APIs.

You can also access these APIs over supported protocols directly:
* [GraphQL](graphql)
* [gRPC](GRPC)
