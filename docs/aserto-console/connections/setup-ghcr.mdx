You'll need to [set up a Github PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens) in order to connect your Aserto account to GHCR.

:::caution Note
Ensure that the selected scopes include at least `repo`, `read:org`, and `write:packages`, so that the Aserto Console has access to the required repository permissions. To be able to delete policy repositores, also provide the `delete:packages` scope.

Navigate to the "Connections" tab:

Click on the "Add a connection" button:

Select the `Github Container Registry (PAT)` provider, name the connection "ghcr" and then use your GitHub PAT to complete the form. Finally, click "Add connection".

Once you've added the new registry, you'll be able to select it when creating policy repositories and images.
