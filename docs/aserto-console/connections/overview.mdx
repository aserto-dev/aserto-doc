# Connections

The Aserto Control Plane manages [connections](/docs/overview/connections) to external systems that are
the source of Aserto artifacts.

Click on the “Connections” tab to see your connections.

## Connection types

The console currently supports three connection types:
1. Identity Providers: [Auth0](/docs/aserto-console/connections/setup-auth0) and [Okta](/docs/aserto-console/connections/setup-okta) (more IDPs will be supported in the future)
2. Source Code Control systems: [Github](/docs/aserto-console/connections/setup-github) and [Gitlab](/docs/aserto-console/connections/setup-gitlab) (more SCMs will be supported in the future)
3. [OCI registries](/docs/aserto-console/connections/setup-opcr) (currently only the [Open Policy Registry](https://www.openpolicyregistry.io/) is supported). In addition, Aserto manages system connections to the Aserto Registry and to the multi-tenant Aserto Authorizer for each tenant.

## Editing or removing a connection

Click the "..." handle on the right side of a connection entry, and select "Edit connection info..." or "Remove".
