# Connections

The Aserto Control Plane manages [connections](/docs/overview/connections) to external systems that are
the source of Aserto artifacts.

Click on the “Connections” tab to see your connections.

## Connection types

The console currently supports three types of connections to external systems:
1. Identity Providers: [Auth0](/docs/aserto-console/connections/setup-auth0), [Azure AD](/docs/aserto-console/connections/setup-azuread) [Okta](/docs/aserto-console/connections/setup-okta) (more IDPs will be supported in the future)
2. Source Code Control systems: [Github](/docs/aserto-console/connections/setup-github) and [Gitlab](/docs/aserto-console/connections/setup-gitlab) (more SCMs will be supported in the future)
3. OCI registries: in addition to the built-in Aserto Policy Registry, [GitHub Packages](/docs/aserto-console/connections/setup-ghcr) is also supported.

## Edge Authorizers

In addition, Aserto has a connection type called Edge Authorizer that makes it easy to connect edge authorizers to the Aserto Control Plane.

## Editing or removing a connection

Click the "..." handle on the right side of a connection entry, and select "Edit connection info..." or "Remove".
