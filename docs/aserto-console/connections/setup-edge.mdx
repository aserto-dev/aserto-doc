## Create an Edge Authorizer connection

Navigate to the "Connections" tab:

Select the `Edge Authorizer` provider, name the connection something like "edge-authorizer", click "Add connection".

Once you've added the Edge Authorizer connection, you'll be able to configure an edge authorizer to create an mTLS connection to the Aserto Control Plane, 
which will then be able to remotely manage that edge authorizer.

## Obtain the connection ID 

Click the Edge Authorizer connection you just created to show the connection ID. This is the connection ID you will use 
when [configuring an edge authorizer](/docs/edge-authorizers/security-and-management).
