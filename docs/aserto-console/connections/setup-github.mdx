### Connecting GitHub using the OAuth2 flow

To connect to GitHub using an OAuth2 flow, click on the "Add a connection" button and select "github". Name
your connection (for example, `github-<account-name>`), and click "Add connection". Once you've completed the
OAuth2 consent flow, your source code provider should show as connected.

### Connecting GitHub using a PAT

To connect to GitHub using a Personal Access Token (PAT), you need to create a PAT in the
[GitHub UI](https://github.com/settings/tokens) by clicking the "Generate new token" button.

:::caution Note
Ensure that the selected scopes include at least `repo`, `read:org`, and `workflow`, 
so that the Aserto Console has access to the required repository information.

Once you've done that, switch back to the Aserto Console. Click on the "Add a connection" button and
select "github-pat". Name your connection, copy the PAT value and paste it into the
"GitHub Personal Access Token" field, and click "Add connection".
