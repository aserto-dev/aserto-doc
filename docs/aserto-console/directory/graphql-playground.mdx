# GraphQL playground

You can use the GraphQL Playground right from within the console to query the Directory GraphQL APIs. 

### Use the Directory Playground

Use the [Directory Playground](https://console.aserto.com/ui/directory/playground) to craft a new query from scratch using the current logged in user and the selected tenant.

### Use the Directory Evaluator

The [Directory Evaluator](https://console.aserto.com/ui/directory/evaluator) provides a builder to help you create a GraphQL query. Once you have the query you can click the `Open in Playground' button and will copy your query into the Playground and open it authenticated from within the Console.
