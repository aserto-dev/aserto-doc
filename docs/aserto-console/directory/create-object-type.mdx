# Creating Object Types

Aserto comes with a set of built-in object types, such as Users and Groups. To create your own object types, you can use the CLI to import a directory schema, or create them using the console. 

Click the "Add Object Type" link in the Directory sidebar to create a new object type, and call it "Organization".

Let's create two instances of the "organization" type: Citadel and Smiths. Click the "Add" button to do this.
