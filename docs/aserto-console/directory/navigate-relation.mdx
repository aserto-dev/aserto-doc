# Navigating Relations

Each object may have named relationships to other objects. For example, Users have a "member" relationship with Group objects.

If you're viewing the "Rick Sanchez" User, you can view and navigate these relationships.

## Viewing incoming relations

Incoming relations are relationships where the current object is the relation's subject. For example,
If you're looking at a User, there will be a "member" relation indicating that the user is the subject of one or more
"group:member" relations.

For example, if you're viewing Rick Sanchez, clicking on the "member" link will show every group which contains Rick as a member.
In the Citadel identity provider, Rick is a member of four groups: "admin-group", "squanch-group", "grandpa-group", and "evil-genius-group".

## Navigating relations

Click the "admin-group" to navigate to that object.

## Relationships are bi-directional

Every relationship can be navigated both ways. To view the Users that are the subjects of the "member" relation for the "admin-group",
click the "Outgoing Relations" tab for the "admin-group" object, and click Rick Sanchez (who is the only admin in this dataset).

Next, we will learn how to add object instances.
