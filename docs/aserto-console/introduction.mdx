# Introduction

Along with the Aserto CLI and the API, the Aserto Console is one of the primary ways
that developers interact with the Aserto control plane.

The Aserto Console has two main functions:

- Manage artifacts (connections, policies, directory)
- Interact with the hosted Authorizer

All management operations are done in the context of an Aserto [organization](/docs/overview/organization). Organizations can be [created and managed](/docs/aserto-console/manage-organizations) in the console.
