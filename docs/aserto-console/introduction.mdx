# Introduction

Along with the Aserto CLI and the API, the Aserto Console is one of the primary ways
that developers interact with the Aserto control plane.

The Aserto Console has two main functions:

- Manage artifacts (connections, policies, directory)
- Interact with the hosted Authorizer

All management operations are done in the context of an Aserto [organization](/docs/overview/organization).

## Switching organizations

The currently selected organization is displayed in the left portion of the navbar of the console. To switch organizations (assuming you have access to more than one organization), select the organization you'd like to manage from the dropdown.

## Managing an organization

As an organization owner, you can manage an organization's members by selecting the "Manage organization" menu item from the organization dropdown.
