# Relation Types

Custom object types are useful when they define relation types that can link them to subjects (e.g. Users, Groups).

Click the "Relations" sidebar tab and then click the "Organization" label. This will show that there are currently no relation types for the Organization object type. Let's add them.

## Creating relation types

Let's create three relation types for our new Organization object type: "viewer", "editor", and "owner".

Click the Add button to add the Owner relation type. 

![org-owner](/org-owner.png)

Repeat for Editor and Viewer.

We should now have three relation types for organizations: owner, editor, and viewer.

Next, we'll add and associate permissions with each relation type.
