# Overview

The Authorizer is an open source authorization engine which uses the
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) (OPA) to
compute a [**decision**](../../architecture/policy/overview#decision) based on a [**policy**](../../architecture/policy/overview),
[**user context**](../../architecture/policy/overview#user-context), and **data**.

An application can interact with the Authorizer through a set of gRPC or HTTPS REST APIs.

## Hosted Authorizer vs Edge Authorizer

Creating an Aserto tenant automatically creates a corresponding Authorizer instance in the multi-tenant hosted Authorizer. Since it's a multi-tenant service, the hosted Authorizer requires authorization headers to disambiguate the tenant and provide the tenant secret (API key).

The Aserto authorizer can also be [deployed as a sidecar (or as a local service)](../../architecture/authorizer/edge-authorizer/overview), right next to your application. Since this Authorizer is a single-tenant service, it does not require authentication, besides the certificate validation mandated by HTTPS mutual TLS.

## Authorization

Any API call to the hosted Authorizer requires two HTTP headers:

- `Aserto-Tenant-ID: <Tenant-ID>`
- `Authorization: basic <Authorizer-API-Key>`

You can find these values in the [Policy settings](../../aserto-console/view-policies#viewing-policy-settings)
in the Aserto Console.

## Authorizer API categories

The Authorizer provides the following API categories to calling applications:

- [Authorization](authz) (`authz`)
- [Policy](policy) (`policy`)
- Information (`info`)

:::note
The v1 [Directory](dir) (`dir`) namespace is now deprecated in favor of the v2 Directory [graphQL APIs](../directory/graphql/overview).

The v1 System (`sys`) namespace is now removed from v2.
