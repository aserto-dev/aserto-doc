# Elastic (ELK) Integration

Ingesting aserto decision logs into an analytics platform, such as [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/) and the rest
of the [ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack), is a great way of leveraging the value of Aserto. The steps
described below can get basic ingestion into ELK configured. We will configure logstash to listen on an Aserto decision
log stream, perform some data augmentation using the Aserto CLI, and stash the results into Elastic.

## Preliminary Requirements

- [The Aserto CLI](/docs/v1/command-line-interface/introduction)
- A tenant id, which can be found in [policy settings](/docs/v1/aserto-console/view-policies#viewing-policy-settings)
- A [decision logs API key](/docs/v1/decision-logs-guide/console#decision-logs-api-key)
- An authorizer API key
- A working Elasticsearch environment
- [Install Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/getting-started-with-logstash.html)
- A working understanding of Logstash

## Example logstash .conf file

In this example, some of the decision events include a resource context containing the id of a user. We use the Aserto
CLI to augment that with the referenced user's email.

The basic .conf file looks like this, note the place-holders for Aserto-tenant-specific data denoted by '< >'.

```json
input {
// Use the Aserto CLI to listen for decision log events and pipe the results through logstash
  pipe {
    command => "aserto l --api-key=<decision-logs-api-key> --tenant=<tenant-id>"
    codec => multiline {
      pattern => "^}"
      negate => true
      what => "next"
    }
  }
}
filter {
  // Ensure we only grab entries that are decision log events  
  json {
    source => "message"
  }
  // Populate Elastic's preferred @timestamp field
  date {
    match => ["[timestamp][seconds]", "UNIX"]
  }
  // Make a copy of the timestamp field as a string, handy with some visualizations
  mutate {
    add_field => {
      "[timestamp_str]" => "%{[@timestamp]}"
    }                                                                                                                                                                                         
  }
  // If the resource context includes a user id, get the email and add a resource.user.email field.
  if [resource][id] {
    http {
      url => "https://authorizer.prod.aserto.com/api/v1/dir/users/%{[resource][id]}"
      verb => "GET"
      headers => {
        "aserto-tenant-id" => "<tenant-id>"
        "authorization" => "basic <authorizer-api-key>"
      }
      add_field => {
        "[resource][user][email]" => "%{[body][result][email]}"
      }
      remove_field => ["body", "headers"]
    }
  }
}
// Stash it!
output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["<elastic hosts>"]
    // Other elastic connection settings. These are specific to your elastic installation and may include:
    // ssl => true
    // cacert => "<path to your elastic server's CA .pem file>"
    // user => "<elastic user>"
    // password => "<elastic password>"
    index => "<your index name>"
    // Use the decision id as a document id. Decision ids are unique, so this prevents duplicate entries.
    document_id => "%{[id]}"
  }                                                                                                                                                                                           
}
```
