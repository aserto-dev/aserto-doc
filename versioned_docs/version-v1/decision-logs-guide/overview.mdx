# Overview

Decision logs are records of the decisions performed by Aserto authorizers that are collected into a central location
by the Aserto control plane. Both hosted and sidecar authorizers can generate decision logs for policies that have them
enabled.

Decision logs can be configured for each policy and viewed on the Aserto [console](console).

Decision logs are stored as objects, each holding about an hour's worth of decisions for a given policy. The
[Aserto API](/docs/v1/decision-logs-guide/api/overview) incudes support for discovering and downloading storage objects and for
accessing a timely view of the most recent decisions.

Integrating Aserto decision log data into data warehousing and analysis tools can be automated using the
[Aserto CLI](/docs/v1/command-line-interface/aserto-cli/decision-logs).
