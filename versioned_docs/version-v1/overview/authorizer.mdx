# Authorizer

The Authorizer is an open source authorization engine which uses the
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) (OPA) to
compute a [**decision**](/docs/v1/overview/policy#decision) based on a [**policy**](/docs/v1/overview/policy),
[**user context**](/docs/v1/overview/policy#user-context), and [**resource context**](/docs/v1/overview/policy#resource-context).

The Authorizer is packaged as a docker image and is meant to be deployed as close as possible
to your application:

- a sidecar container in the same pod as the application (if you're running in Kubernetes)
- a service that is deployed in the same subnet as your application (if not)

In addition, when you create an Aserto [organization](/docs/v1/overview/organization), an Authorizer instance
in Aserto's multi-tenant hosted authorizer service is provisioned for you. Since the APIs are identical to 
the sidecar authorizer, using the hosted authorizer is the easiest way to start building applications that 
use Aserto.

Finally, the same container image underpins Aserto's local developer experience, which you can
deploy on your local workstation using the Aserto [CLI](/docs/v1/command-line-interface/introduction), and
use while developing your application. This helps create a tight development workflow that has no
external dependencies.

## Concepts

The main concepts for the Authorizer are:

- [Policy](/docs/v1/overview/policy): a set of rules for making an authorization decision
- [Decision](/docs/v1/overview/policy#decision): an output of the policy
- [User context](/docs/v1/overview/policy#user-context): a set of user _properties_, _roles_, and _scopes_ that can be used in a policy to determine the outcome of decisions
- [Resource context](/docs/v1/overview/policy#resource-context): additional resource data (often in the form of lookup tables) that is used in determining the outcome of decisions
