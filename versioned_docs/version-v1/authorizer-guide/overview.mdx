# Overview

The Authorizer is an open source authorization engine which uses the
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) (OPA) to
compute a [**decision**](/docs/v1/overview/policy#decision) based on a [**policy**](/docs/v1/overview/policy),
[**user context**](/docs/v1/overview/policy#user-context), and **data**.

An application can interact with the Authorizer through a set of gRPC or HTTPS REST APIs.

## Hosted Authorizer vs Edge Authorizer

Creating an Aserto tenant automatically creates a corresponding Authorizer instance in the multi-tenant hosted Authorizer. Since it's a multi-tenant service, the hosted Authorizer requires authorization headers to disambiguate the tenant and provide the tenant secret (API key).

The Aserto authorizer can also be [deployed as a sidecar (or as a local service)](/docs/v1/edge-authorizers/overview), right next to your application. Since this Authorizer is a single-tenant service, it does not require authentication, besides the certificate validation mandated by HTTPS mutual TLS.

## Authorization

Any API call to the hosted Authorizer requires two HTTP headers:

- `Aserto-Tenant-ID: <Tenant-ID>`
- `Authorization: basic <Authorizer-API-Key>`

You can find these values in the [Policy settings](/docs/v1/aserto-console/view-policies#viewing-policy-settings)
in the Aserto Console.

## Authorizer API categories

The Authorizer provides the following API categories to calling applications:

- [Authorization](/docs/v1/authorizer-guide/authz) (`authz`)
- [Policy](/docs/v1/authorizer-guide/policy) (`policy`)
- Information (`info`)

:::note
The v1 [Directory](/docs/v1/authorizer-guide/dir) (`dir`) namespace is now deprecated in favor of the v2 Directory [graphQL APIs](/docs/v1/directory-guide/scenario).

The v1 System (`sys`) namespace is now removed from v2.
