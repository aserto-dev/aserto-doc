# Authorization

The Authorizer makes three APIs available to the calling application for the purpose of
authorization:

- [`authz/is`](is.mdx)
- [`authz/query`](query.mdx)
- [`authz/decisiontree`](decisiontree.mdx)

Each of these APIs is a `POST` style API and accepts an input payload.

The payload for each of these APIs includes three common objects:

- [Identity context](identity-context.mdx) identifies the user
- [Policy context](policy-context.mdx) identifies the path and decisions
- [Policy instance](policy-instance.mdx) identifies the policy instance
- [Resource context](resource-context.mdx) identifies the (optional) resource
